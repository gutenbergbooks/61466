<h2 id="AUTHORS_PROLOGUE">AUTHOR’S PROLOGUE</h2>

<p><i>If one were in the vein for the colours and haunted mists of
Romance; if the thing, perhaps, were not so serious, there
might be composed, and by me, a Romance of Queens out of
my acquaintance with four ladies of that degree; among
whom—to adopt the terms proper—were the Queen of Gall,
the Queen of Ferment, and the Queen of Wine and Honey.
You see that one would employ, for the occasion, the language
of poets to designate the Queen-Mother of France, the Queen-Maid
of England, and the too-fair Queen of Scots: to omit
the fourth queen from such a tale would be for superstition’s
sake, and not for lack of matter—I mean Queen Venus, who
(God be witness) played her part in the affairs of her mortal
sisters, and proclaimed her prerogatives by curtailing theirs.
But either the matter is too serious, or I am. I see flesh and
spirit involved in all this, truth and lies, God and the Devil—dreadful
concernments of our own, with which Romance
has no profitable traffic. La Bele Isoud, the divine Oriana,
Aude the Fair (whom Roland loved)—tender ghosts, one and
all of them, whose heartaches were so melodious that they
have filled four-and-twenty pleasant volumes, and yet so
unsubstantial that no one feels one penny the worse, or the
better, for them afterwards. But here! Ah, here we have
real players in a game tremendously real; and the hearts
they seem to play with were once bright with lively blood;
and the lies they told should have made streaks on lips once
vividly incarnate—and sometimes did it. Real! Why, not
long ago you could have seen a little pair of black satin
slippers, sadly down at heel, which may have paced with
Riccio’s in the gallery at Wemyss, or tapped the floor of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
Holyroodhouse while King Henry Darnley was blustering
there, trying to show his manhood. A book about Queen
Mary—if it be honest—has no business to be a genteel exercise
in the romantic: if the truth is to be told, let it be there.</i></p>

<p class="tb"><i>A quair is a <span class="antiqua">cahier</span>, a quire, a little book. In one such a
certain king wrote fairly the tale of his love-business; and
here, in this other, I pretend to show you all the tragic error,
all the pain, known only to her that moved in it, of that
child of his children’s children, Mary of Scotland. What
others have guessed at, building surmise upon surmise,
she knew; for what they did, she suffered. Some who
were closest about her—women, boys—may have known
some: Claude Nau got some from her; my Master Des-Essars
got much. But the whole of it lay in her heart, and
to know her is to hold the key of that. Suppose her hand
had been at this pen; suppose mine had turned that key:
there might have resulted ‘The Queen’s Quair.’ Well!
Suppose one or the other until the book is done—and then
judge me.</i></p>

<p><i>Questions for King Œdipus, Riddle of the Sphinx,
Mystery of Queen Mary! She herself is the Mystery; the
rest is simple enough. There had been men in Scotland from
old time, and Stuarts for six generations to break themselves
upon them. Great in thought, frail in deed, adventurous,
chivalrous, hardy, short of hold, doomed to fail at the touch—so
ventured, so failed the Stuarts from the first James to
the fifth. There had been men in Scotland, but no women.
Forth from the Lady of Lorraine came the lass, born in an
unhappy hour, tossing high her young head, saying, ‘Let me
alone to rule wild Scotland.’ They had but to give her house-room:
no mystery there. The mystery is that any mystery
has been found. Maids’ Adventure—with that we begin.
A bevy of maids to rule wild Scotland! What mystery is
there in that? Or—since Mystery is double-edged, engaging
what we dare not, as well as what we cannot, tell—what
mystery but that?</i></p>

<p><i>A hundred books have been written, a hundred songs
sung; men enough of these latter days have broken their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
hearts for Queen Mary’s. What is more to the matter is
that no heart but hers was broken in time. All the world
can love her now; but who loved her then? Not a man
among them. A few girls went weeping; a few boys laid
down their necks that she might walk free of the mire.
Alas! the mire swallowed them up, and she must soil her
pretty feet. This is the nut of the tragedy; pity is involved
rather than terror. But no song ever pierced the fold of her
secret, no book ever found out the truth, because none ever
sought her heart. Here, then, is a book which has sought
nothing else, and a song which springs from that only:
called, on that same account, ‘The Queen’s Quair.’</i></p>

<p>It is quite true that when they had buried the little wasted
King Francis, and while the days of Black Dule still held,
the Cardinal of Lorraine tried three times to see his niece,
and was three times refused. Not being man enough to
break a way in, he retired; but as he knew very well that
the Queen-Mother, the King, the King of Navarre, and
Madame Marguerite went in and out all day long, he had
a suspicion that they, or the seasons, were more at fault
than the hidden mourner. ‘A time, times, and half a
time,’ he said, ‘have good scriptural warrant. I will try
once more—at this hour of high mass.’ So he did, and
saw Mary Livingstone, that strapping girl, who came into
the antechamber, rather flushed, and devoutly kissed his ring.</p>

<p>‘How is it with the Queen my niece?’</p>

<p>‘Sadly, Eminence.’</p>

<p>‘I must know how sadly, my girl. I must see her. It
is of great concern.’</p>

<p>The young woman looked scared. ‘Eminence, she sees
only the Queen-Mother.’</p>

<p>‘The more reason,’ says he, ‘why she should see somebody
else. She may be praying one of these fine days
that she never see the Queen-Mother again.’</p>

<p>Livingstone coloured up to the eyes. ‘Oh, sir! Oh,
Lord Cardinal, and so she doth, and so do we all! They
are dealing wickedly with our mistress. It is true, what
I told you, that she sees the Queen-Mother: that is because
her Majesty will not be denied. She forces the doors—she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
hath had a door taken down. She comes and goes as she
will; rails at our lady before us all. She, poor lamb, what
can she do? Oh, sir, if you could stop this traffic I would
let you in of my own venture.’</p>

<p>‘Take me in, then,’ said the cardinal: ‘I will stop it.’</p>

<p>In the semi-dark he found his niece, throned upon the
knee of Mary Beaton for comfort, in heavy black weeds,
out of which the sharp oval of her face and the crescent
white coif gleamed like two moons, the old within the
new. Two other maids sat on the floor near by; each had
a hand of her—pitiful sentinels of spoiled treasure. When
the gentleman-usher at the curtain was forestalled by the
great man’s quick entry, four girls rose at once, as a covey
of partridges out of corn, and all but the Queen fell upon
their knees. She, hugging herself as if suddenly chilled,
came forward a little, not very far, and held out to the
cardinal an unwilling hand. He took it, laid it on his
own, kissed, and let it drop immediately. Then he stood
upright, sniffed, and looked about him, being so near the
blood royal himself that he could use familiarity with
princes. It was clear that he disapproved.</p>

<p>‘Faith of a gentleman!’ he said: ‘one might see a
little better, one might breathe a little better, here, my
niece.’</p>

<p>‘The room is well enough,’ said the Queen.</p>

<p>It was dark and hot, heavy with some thick scent.</p>

<p>As she pronounced upon it the cardinal paused half-way
to the shutter; but he paused too slightly. The Queen
flushed all over and went quickly between him and the
window—a vehement action. ‘Leave it, leave it alone!
I choose my own way. You dare not touch it.’ She
spoke furiously; he bowed his grey head and drew back.
Then, in a minute, she herself flung back the shutters, and
stood trembling in the sudden glory revealed. The broad
flood of day showed him the waves of storm still surging
over her; but even as he approved she commanded herself
and became humble—he knew her difficult to resist in that
mood.</p>

<p>‘I thought you would treat me as the Queen-Mother
does. That put me in a rage. I beg your pardon, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
lord.’ As she held out her hand again, this time he took
it, and drew her by it along with him to the open window.
He made her stand in the sun. Far below the grey
curtain-wall were the moat, the bridges, the trim gardens
and steep red roofs of Orleans, the spired bulk of the great
church; beyond all that the gay green countryside. A
fresh wind was blowing out there. You saw the willows
bend, the river cream and curd. The keen strength of
day and the weather made her blink; but he braced her
to meet it by his words.</p>

<p>‘Madam,’ said he, ‘needs must your heart uplift to see
God’s good world still shining in its place, patient until
your Majesty tires of sitting in the dark.’</p>

<p>She smiled awry, and drummed on the ledge with her
long fingers, looking wilfully down, not choosing to agree.
The maids, all clustered together, watched their beloved;
but the cardinal had saner eyes than any of them. As he
saw her, so may you and I.</p>

<p>A tall, slim girl, petted and pettish, pale (yet not
unwholesome), chestnut-haired, she looked like a flower of
the heat, lax and delicate. Her skin—but more, the very
flesh of her—seemed transparent, with colour that warmed
it from within, faintly, with a glow of fine rose. They
said that when she drank you could see the red wine run
like a fire down her throat; and it may partly be believed.
Others have reported that her heart could be discerned
beating within her body, and raying out a ruddy light,
now fierce, now languid, through every crystal member.
The cardinal, who was no rhapsodist of the sort, admitted
her clear skin, admitted her patent royalty, but denied
that she was a beautiful girl—even for a queen. Her
nose, he judged, was too long, her lips were too thin, her
eyes too narrow. He detested her trick of the sidelong
look. Her lower lids were nearly straight, her upper
rather heavy: between them they gave her a sleepy
appearance, sometimes a sly appearance, when, slowly
lifting, they revealed the glimmering hazel of the eyes
themselves. Hazel, I say, if hazel they were, which
sometimes seemed to be yellow, and sometimes showed
all black: the light acted upon hers as upon a cat’s eyes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Beautiful she may not have been, though Monsieur de
Brantôme would never allow it; but fine, fine she was all
over—sharply, exquisitely cut and modelled: her sweet
smooth chin, her amorous lips, bright red where all else
was pale as a tinged rose; her sensitive nose; her broad,
high brows; her neck which two hands could hold, her
small shoulders and bosom of a child. And then her
hands, her waist no bigger than a stalk, her little feet!
She had sometimes an intent, considering, wise look—the
look of the Queen of Desire, who knew not where to set
the bounds of her need, but revealed to no one what that
was. And belying that look askance of hers—sly, or wise,
or sleepy, as you choose—her voice was bold and very
clear, her manners were those of a lively, graceful boy, her
gestures quick, her spirit impatient and entirely without
fear. Her changes of mood were dangerous: she could
wheedle the soul out of a saint, and then fling it back to
him as worthless because it had been so easily got. She
wrote a beautiful bold hand, loved learning, and petting,
and a choice phrase. She used perfumes, and dipped her
body every day in a bath of wine. At this hour she was
nineteen years old, and not two months a widow.</p>

<p>All this the cardinal knew by heart, and had no need
to observe while she stood strumming at the window-sill.
His opinion—if he had chosen to give it—would have
been: these qualities and perfections, ah, and these
imperfections, are all very proper to a prince who has a
principality; for my niece, I count greatly upon a wise
marriage—wise for our family, wise for herself. He
would have been the last to deny that the Guises had
been hampered by King Francis’ decease. All was to do
again—but all could be done. This fretful, fair girl was
still Queen of Scotland, <i>allons</i>! Dowager of France, but
Queen of Scotland, worth a knight’s venture. Advance
pawns, therefore! He was a chess-player, passionate for
the game.</p>

<p>He surveyed the maids of honour, bouncing Livingstone
and the rest of them, too zealous after their mistress’s ease,
and too jealous lest the world should edge them out; and
found that he had more zest for the world and the spring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
weather. ‘Ah, madam,’ he said, ‘ah, my niece, this
cloister-life of stroking, and kindly knees, is not one for
your Majesty. There are high roads out yonder to be
traversed, armies to set upon them, cities and towns and
hill-crests to be taken. But you sit at home in the dark,
nursed by your maids!’</p>

<p>She raised her eyebrows, not her eyes. ‘Why,’ says she,
‘the King, my husband, is dead, and most of his people
glad of it, I believe. If my kingdom lies within these four
walls, and my government is but over these poor girls, they
are my own. What else should I do? Walk abroad to
mass? Ride abroad to the meadows? And be mocked by
the people for a barren wife, who never was wife at all?
And be browbeat openly by the Apothecary’s Daughter?
Is this what you set before me, Lord Cardinal?’</p>

<p>The cardinal put up his chin and cupped his beard.
‘The rich may call themselves poor, the poor dare not.
You have a realm, my niece, and a fair realm. You stand
at the door of a second. You may yet have a third, it
seems to me.’</p>

<p>Queen Mary looked at him then, with a gleam in her
eyes which answered for a smile. But she hid her mind
almost at once, and resumed her drumming.</p>

<p>‘King Charles is hot for me,’ she said. ‘He is a brave
lad. I should be Queen of France again—of France and
England and Scotland.’ She laughed softly to herself, as
if snug in the remembrance that she was still sought.</p>

<p>The cardinal became exceedingly serious. ‘I have
thought of that. To my mind there is a beautiful
justice——! What our family can do shall be done—but,
alas——!’</p>

<p>She broke in upon him here. ‘Our family, my lord!
<i>Your</i> family! Ah, that was a good marriage for me, for
example, which you made! That ailing child! Death
was in his bed before ever I was put there. My marriage!
My husband! He used to cry all night of the pain in his
head. He clung to the coverlet, and to me, lest they should
pull him out to prayers. Marriage! He was cankered from
his birth. What king was Francis, to make me a queen?’</p>

<p>The cardinal lifted his fine head. ‘It was my sister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Marie who made you a queen, madam, by the grace of
God and King James. Through your parentage you are
Queen of Scotland, and should be Queen of England—and
you shall be. God of gods, you may be queen of whatso
realm you please. What do I learn? The whole world’s
mind runs upon the marrying of you. The Archduke
Ferdinand hath here his ambassadors, attendant on the
Queen-Mother’s pleasure—which you allow to be yours
also. Don Carlos, his own hand at the pen, writes for a
hope of your Majesty’s. The Earl of Huntly, a great and
religious prince in Scotland, urges the pretensions of his
son, the Lord of Gordon. Are these to be laid before
the Queen-Mother? To the duchess, your grandmother,
writeth daily the Duke of Châtelherault concerning his son,
the Earl of Arran. On his side is my brother the Constable.
More! They bring me word from England that the Earl
of Lennox, next in blood to your Majesty, next indeed to
both your thrones, is hopeful to come to France—he, too,
with a son in his pocket, young, apt, and lovely as a love-apple.
All these hopeful princes, madam——’</p>

<p>Queen Mary coloured. With difficulty she said: ‘I
hear of every one of them for the first time.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, madam,’ cried the cardinal, ‘so long as you sit on
your maids’ knees and give the keys of your chamber to
the Queen-Mother, you will only hear what she please to
tell you. And more’—he raised his voice, and gave it
severity—‘I take leave to add that so long as your Majesty
hath Mistress Livingstone here for your husband, your
Majesty can look for no other.’</p>

<p>‘I am never likely to look on a better,’ says Queen
Mary, and put her hand behind her. Mary Livingstone
stooped quickly and snatched a kiss from the palm, while
the cardinal gazed steadily out of doors. But he felt more
at ease, being sure that he had leavened his lump.</p>

<p>And so he had. The sweet fact of great marriages
beyond her doors, and the sour fact of the Queen-Mother
within them, worked a ferment in her brain and set her at
her darling joy of busy scheming. What turned the scale
over was the mortifying discovery that Catherine de’
Medici was in reality dying to get rid of her. She flew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
into a great rage, changed her black mourning for white,
announced her departure, paid her farewells, and went to
her grandmother’s court at Rheims. Queen Catherine
watched her, darkling, from a turret as she rode gaily out in
her troop of Guises. ‘There,’ she is reported to have said,
I know not whether truly or not, ‘there goes Madam
Venus a-hunting the apple. Alas for Shepherd Paris!’
The reflection is a shrewd one at least; but it was not then
so certain that Orleans had seen the last of Queen Mary.
It was no way to get her out of France to tell her there
was nothing you desired so much.</p>

<p>The old duchess, her grandam, talked marriages and the
throne of Scotland, therefore, into ears only half willing.
The little Queen was by no means averse to either, but
could not bring herself to lose hold upon France. ‘Better
to be Dowager of France than an Empress in the north,’
she said; and then ‘Fiddle-de-dee, my child,’ the old lady
retorted; ‘give me a live dog before a dead lion. Your
desire here is to vex La Medicis. You would make eyes
at King Charles, and we should all lose our heads. Do
you wish to end your days at Loches? The Duke of
Milan found cold quarters there, they tell me. No, no.
Marry a king’s son and recover England from the Bastard.’
Thus all France spake of our great Elizabeth.</p>

<p>Queen Mary, though she loved her grandmother, pinched
her lip, looked meek, and hardened her heart. She had
obstinacy by the father’s mother’s side—a Tudor virtue.</p>

<p>It was just after she had gone to Nancy, to the court of
her cousin of Lorraine, that she veered across to the side
of the Guises and determined to adventure in Scotland.
Two Scots lords came overseas to visit her there: one
was the Lord James Stuart, her base-brother, the other a
certain Father Lesley, an old friend of her mother’s. The
priest was a timid man, but by good hap and slenderness
of equipage gained her first. She might have been sure
he was a faithful friend, though doubtful if a very wise one.
Faithful enough he proved in days to come: at this present
she found him a simple, fatherly man, of wandering mind,
familiar, benevolent, soon scared. He was enchanted with
her, and said so. He praised her person, the scarlet of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
lips, the bright hue of her hair. ‘A bonny brown, my
child,’ he said, touching it, ‘to my partial eyes.’ She
laughed as she told him that in Paris also they had liked
the colour. ‘They will call it foxy in Scotland,’ he said,
with a sniff; and she found out afterwards that they did.
At first she was ‘madam’ here, and ‘your Majesty’ there;
but as the talk warmed him he forgot her queenship in her
extreme youth, had her hand in his own and patted it with
the other. Then it came to ‘Child, this you should do,’ or
‘Child, I hope that is not your usage’; and once he went
so far as to hold her by the hands at arms’ length and peer
at her through his kind, weak eyes, up and down, as he
said to himself, ‘Eh, sirs, a tall bit lassie to stand by
Bruce’s chair! But her mother was just such another one—just
such another.’</p>

<p>She thought this too far to go, even for a churchman,
and drew off with a smile and shake of the head—not
enough to humiliate him.</p>

<p>He cautioned her with fearful winks and nods against
the Lord James Stuart, her half-brother, hinting more than
he dared to tell. ‘That man hath narrow eyes,’ he said;
then, recollecting himself, ‘and so hath your Majesty by
right of blood. All the Stuarts have them—the base and
the true. But his, remark, are most guarded eyes, so that
you shall not easily discover in what direction he casts his
looks. But I say, madam,’—and he raised his wiry voice,—‘I
say that the throne is ever at his right hand; and I
do think that he looks ever to the right.’</p>

<p>The Queen’s eyes were plain enough at this—squirrel-colour,
straight as arrows. Being free-spoken herself, she
disliked periphrasis. ‘Does my brother desire my throne?
Is this your meaning?’</p>

<p>He jumped back as if she had whipped him, and crossed
himself vehemently, saying, ‘God forbid it! God forbid it!’</p>

<p>‘I shall forbid it, whether or no,’ said the Queen. ‘But
I suppose you had some such meaning behind your speech.’
And she pressed him until she learned that such indeed
was the belief in Scotland.</p>

<p>‘Your misborn brother, madam,’ he said, whispering,
‘will tell you nothing that he believeth, and ask you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
nothing that he desireth; nor will he any man. He will
urge you to the contrary of what he truly requires. He
will take his profit of another man’s sin and rejoice to see
his own hands clean. My heart,’ he said, forgetting himself,—and
‘Ah, Jesu!’ she records, ‘I was called that
again, and by another mouth,’—‘My heart, if you tender
the peace of Holy Church in your land, keep your brother
James in France under lock and key.’</p>

<p>She laughed at his alarms. ‘I wish liberty to all men
and their consciences sir. I am sure I shall find friends
in Scotland.’</p>

<p>He named the great Earl of Huntly and his four sons;
but by now she was tired of him and sent him away. All
the effect of the poor man’s speeches had been to make her
anxious to measure wits with her base-brother. He came
in two or three days later with a great train, and she had
her opportunity.</p>

<p>What she made of it you may judge by this, that it was
he and no other who spurred her into Scotland. He did it,
in a manner very much his own, by first urging it and then
discovering impossible fatigues in the road. This shows
him to have been, what he was careful to conceal, a student
of human kind.</p>

<p>A certain French valet of the Earl of Bothwell’s—Nicolas
Hubart, from whose <i>Confessions</i> I shall have to
draw liberally by-and-by, and of whom, himself, there will
be plenty to say—made once an acute observation of the
great Lord James, when he said that he was that sort of
man who, if he had not a black cloak for Sunday, would
be an atheist or even an epicurean. There was no one,
certainly, who had a more intense regard for decent
observance than he. It was his very vesture: he would
have starved or frozen without it. It clothed him completely
from head to foot, and from the heart outwards.
Much more than that. There are many in this world who
go about it swathed up to the eyes, imposing upon those
they meet. But this man imposed first of all upon himself.
So complete was his robing, he could not see himself out of it.
So white were his hands, so flawless of grit, he could never
see them otherwise. Supposing Father Lesley to have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
right, supposing that James Stuart did—and throughout—plot
for a throne, he would have been the first to cry out
upon the vice of Brutus. It may well be doubted whether
he once, in all his life, stood alone—so to speak—naked
before his own soul. Perhaps such a man can hardly be
deemed a sinner, whatever he do. There are those at this
hour who say that the Lord James was no sinner. How
should he be? they cry. His own soul never knew it.</p>

<p>This tall, pale, inordinately prim nobleman, with his
black beard, black clothes, and (to the Queen’s mind) black
beliefs, seemed to walk for ever in a mask of sour passivity.
He never spoke when to bow the head could be an answer,
he never affirmed without qualification, he never denied or
refused anything as of his own opinion. He was allowed
to have extraordinarily fine manners, even in France, where
alacrity of service counted for more than the service itself;
and yet Queen Mary declared that she had never seen a
man enter a doorway so long after he had opened the door.
He seldom looked at you. His voice was low and measured.
He cleared his throat before he spoke, and swallowed the
moment he had finished, as if he were anxious to engulf
any possible effect of his words. Of all the ties upon a
man he dreaded most those of the heart-strings: she never
moved him to natural emotion but once. But, at this first
coming of his, he paid her great court, and bent his stiff
knees to her many times a day: this notwithstanding that,
as Mary Seton affirmed, he had water on one of them.
She said that she had that from his chaplain, but her love
of mischief had betrayed her love of truth. The Lord
James always stood to his prayers.</p>

<p>When the Queen saw him first it was in the presence of
her women, of Lord Eglinton, of the Marquis D’Elbœuf,
and others—persons who either hated him with reason or
despised him with none. He moved her then, almost with
passion, to go ‘home’ to Scotland, saying that it behoved
princes to dwell among their own people. But at a privy
audience a few days later, he held to another tune altogether,
pursing his lips, twiddling his two thumbs, looking up and
down and about. Now he said that he was not sure; that
there were dangers attending a Popish Queen, and those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
not only within the kingdom but without it. She begged
him to explain himself.</p>

<p>‘Better bide, madam,’ said he, ‘until the wind change in
England.’</p>

<p>Any word of England always excited her. The colour
flew to her face. ‘What hath my sister in England to do
with my kingdom, good brother?’</p>

<p>‘Why, madam,’ he said, ‘it has come to my sure knowledge
that you shall get no safe-conduct from the English
Queen, to go smoothly to Scotland.’</p>

<p>He never watched any one, or was never observed to be
watching; but his guarded eyes, glancing at her as they
shifted, showed him that, being angry now, she was beautiful—like
a spirit of the fire.</p>

<p>‘I should be offended at what you report if I believed it
possible,’ she said after a while. ‘And yet England is not
the only road, nor is it the best road, to my kingdom.’</p>

<p>‘No indeed, madam,’ he agreed; ‘but it is the only
easy road for a young and delicate lady.’</p>

<p>‘Let my youth, brother, be as God made it,’ she
answered him; ‘but as for my delicacy, I am thankfully
able to bear fatigue and to thrive upon it. If my good
sister, or you, my lord’—she spoke very clearly—‘think
to keep me from my own by threats of force or warnings
of danger, I would have you understand that the like of
those is a spur to me.’</p>

<p>This was a thing which, in fact, he had understood
perfectly.</p>

<p>‘I am not a shying horse,’ she continued, ‘to swerve at
a heap of sand. I believe I shall find loyalty in my
country, and cheerful courage there to meet my own
courage. There be those that laugh at danger there, as
well as those who weep.’</p>

<p>He said suavely here that she misjudged him, that only
his tenderness for her person was at fault. ‘We grow
timid where we love much, madam.’</p>

<p>At this she looked at him so unequivocally that he
changed the subject.</p>

<p>‘If your Majesty,’ he pursued, ‘knows not the mind of
the English Queen, or misdoubts my reading of it, let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
application be made to Master Throckmorton. I am content
to be judged out of his mouth.’</p>

<p>Master Throckmorton was English Ambassador to the
Queen of Scots, a friend of the Lord James’s. His lordship,
indeed, had the greater confidence in giving this
advice in that he had already convinced Master Throckmorton
of what he must do, and what say, if he wished
to get Queen Mary into Scotland—as, namely, decline to
help her thither; decline, for instance, a letter of safe-conduct
through English soil.</p>

<p>‘Let application be made presently, brother,’ said
the incensed young lady, and gladly turned to her
pleasures.</p>

<p>She had been finding these of late in a society not at all
to the mind of the Lord James. Three days before this
conversation the Earl of Bothwell, no less, had come to
court, making for the North from Piedmont.</p>

<p>In years to come she could remember every flash and
eddy of that shifting garden scene when first he came to
her. A waft of scented blossom, the throb of a lute, and
she could see the peacock on the wall, the gay June
borders, the grass plats and bright paths in between,
quivering with the heat they gave out. There was a
fountain in the midst of the quincunx, on the marble brim
of which she sat with her maids and cousin D’Elbœuf,
dipping her hand, and now and then flicking water into
their faces. A page in scarlet and white had come running
up to say that the Duke was nearing with his gentlemen;
and presently down the long alley she saw them moving
slowly—crimson cloaks and bared heads, the Duke in the
midst, wearing his jewelled bonnet. He was talking, and
laughing immoderately with some one she knew not at all,
who swung his hat in his hand, and to whom, as she remembered
vividly, the struck poppies bowed their heads.
For he hit them as he went with his hat, and looked round
to see them fall. The Duke’s tale continued to the very
verge of the privy garden; indeed he halted there, in the
face of her usher, to finish it. She saw the stranger throw
back his head to laugh. ‘What a great jowl he hath,’ she
said to Mary Fleming; and she, in a hush, said, ‘Madam,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
it is the Earl Bothwell.’ A few moments later the man
was kneeling before her, presented by the Duke himself.
She had time to notice the page to whom he had thrown
his hat and gloves—a pale-faced, wise-looking French boy,
who knelt also, and watched her from a pair of grey eyes
‘rimmed with smut-colour.’ His name, she found out
afterwards, was Jean-Marie-Baptiste Des-Essars. She liked
his manly looks from the first—little knowing who and
what he was to be to her. Jean-Marie-Baptiste Des-Essars!
Keeper of the <i>Secret des Secrets</i>—where should I
be without him?</p>

<p>The Earl of Bothwell—whom she judged (in spite of
the stricken poppies) to be good-humoured—was a galliard
of the type esteemed in France by those—and they were
many—who pronounced vice to be their virtue. A galliard,
as they say, if ever there was one, flushed with rich blood,
broad-shouldered, square-jawed, with a laugh so happy and
so prompt that the world, rejoicing to hear it, thought all
must be well wherever he might be. He wore brave clothes,
sat a brave horse, kept brave company bravely. His high
colour, while it betokened high feeding, got him the credit
of good health. His little eyes twinkled so merrily that
you did not see they were like a pig’s, sly and greedy at
once, and bloodshot. His tawny beard concealed a jaw
underhung, a chin jutting and dangerous. His mouth had
a cruel twist; but his laughing hid that too. The bridge
of his nose had been broken; few observed it, or guessed
at the brawl which must have given it him. Frankness
was his great charm, careless ease in high places, an air of
‘take me or leave me, I go my way’; but some mockery
latent in him, and the suspicion that whatever you said or
did he would have you in derision—this was what first
drew Queen Mary to consider him. And she grew to look
for it—in those twinkling eyes, in that quick mouth; and
to wonder about it, whether it was with him always—asleep,
at prayers, fighting, furious, in love. In fine, he
made her think.</p>

<p>Mary Livingstone liked not the looks of him from the
first, and held him off as much as she could. She slept
with her mistress in these days of widowhood, but refused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
to discuss him in bed. She said that he had a saucy eye—which
was not denied—and was too masterful.</p>

<p>‘You can tell it by the hateful growth of hair he hath,’
she cried. ‘When he lifts up his head to laugh—and he
would laugh, mind you, at the crucified Saviour!—you can
see the climbing of his red beard, like rooted ivy on an old
wall.’</p>

<p>It is true that his beard was reddish, and gross-growing;
his hair, however, was dark brown, thick and curling.
Mary Livingstone sniffed at his hair. He stayed ten days
at Nancy, saw the Queen upon each of them, and on each
held converse with her. She liked him very well, studied
him, thought him more important than he really was. He
laughed at her for this, and taxed her with it; but so
pleasantly that she was not at all offended. The Lord
James would not speak of him, nor he of the Lord James:
he shrugged at any reference to him.</p>

<p>‘Let it be enough, madam, to own that we do not love
each other,’ he said when she pressed him. ‘We view the
world differently, that lord and I; for I look on the evil
and the good with open face and what cheer I can muster,
and he looks through his fingers and sadly. We speak
little one with the other: what he thinks of me I know not.
I think him a——’</p>

<p>‘Well, my lord? You think my brother a——?’</p>

<p>‘A king’s son, madam,’ he said, demurely; but she saw
the gleam in his eye.</p>

<p>He spoke fluent French, and was very ready with his
Italian. He was a latinist, a student of warfare, had read
Machiavelli. He scared away a good many poetasters by
a real or an affected truculence; threatened to duck one of
them in the fountain, and proved that he could do it by
ducking another. The effect of this was, as he had
intended, that Queen Mary for a day laughed with him at
the art of poetry, which was no art of his. That day he
had a private half-hour, and spoke freely of himself and his
ventures.</p>

<p>‘A man rich in desires,’ he confessed himself, ‘and
therefore of great wealth. Put the peach on the wall above
me, madam, and I shall surely grow to handle it. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
this other possession is mine, that while I strive and stretch
after my prize I can laugh at my own pains, and yet not
abate them.’</p>

<p>She considered every word he said, and dubbed him
Democritus, her laughing philosopher.</p>

<p>‘You will have need of my sect in Scotland, madam,’
he replied with a bow. ‘Despise it not; for in that grey
country the very skies invite us to mingle tears. You have
a weeper beside you even now—the Lord Heraclitus, a
king’s son.’</p>

<p>She had no difficulty in discovering her stiff brother
James under this thin veil.</p>

<p>All was going on thus well with my Lord of Bothwell
when Mary Livingstone heard him rate his page in the
forecourt one morning as she came back from the mass.
She caught sight also of ‘his inflamed and wicked face,’
and saw the little French boy flinch and turn his shoulder
to a flood of words, of which she understood not half. She
guessed at them from the rest. ‘They must needs be worse;
and yet how can they be? And oh! the poor little Stoic
with his white face!’ The good girl snapped her lips
together as she hurried on. ‘He shall see as little of my
bonny Queen as I can provide for,’ she promised herself.
‘I have heard sculduddery enough to befoul all Burgundy.’
Being a wise virgin, she said little to her mistress save to
urge her to beg the French boy from his master.</p>

<p>‘Why do you want him, child?’ the Queen asked.</p>

<p>‘He hath a steadfast look, and loves you. I think he
will serve your needs. Get him if you care,’ was all the
reply she could win.</p>

<p>The thing was easily done, lightly asked and lightly
accorded.</p>

<p>‘Baptist, come hither,’ had cried my lord; and the boy
knelt before the lady. ‘I have sold thee, Baptist.’</p>

<p>‘Very good, monseigneur.’</p>

<p>The Queen sparkled and smiled upon him. ‘Wilt thou
come with me, Jean-Marie?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, willingly, madam.’</p>

<p>‘And do me good service?’</p>

<p>‘Nobody in the world shall do better, madam.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>‘But you are positive, my boy!’</p>

<p>‘I do well to be positive, madam, in such a cause as your
Majesty’s.’</p>

<p>She turned to the Earl. ‘What is his history?’</p>

<p>He shrugged. ‘The Sieur Des-Essars—a gentleman
of Brabant—disporting in La Beauce, accosts a pretty
Disaster (to call her so) with a speaking eye——’</p>

<p>Jean-Marie-Baptiste held up his hand. ‘Monseigneur,
ah——!’</p>

<p>‘How now, cockerel?’</p>

<p>‘You speak of my mother, sir,’ he said, his lip quivering.</p>

<p>‘By the Mass, and so I do!’ said the Earl.</p>

<p>The Queen patted the lad’s shoulder before she sent
him away. ‘You shall tell me all about your mother, Jean-Marie,
when we are in Scotland.’</p>

<p>Jean-Marie-Baptiste Des-Essars quickly kissed her sleeve,
and became her man. More of him in due time, and of
what he saw out of his ‘smut-rimmed’ eyes.</p>

<p class="tb">When English Mr. Throckmorton was reported as
within a day’s ride of Nancy, my Lord Bothwell thought
it wise to take leave. His odour in England was not good,
and he knew very well that the Lord James would not
sprinkle him with anything which would make it better.
So he presented himself betimes in the morning, said his
<i>adieux</i> and kissed hands.</p>

<p>‘Farewell, my lord,’ says Queen Mary. ‘Lorraine will
be the sadder for your going.’</p>

<p>‘And ever fare your Majesty well,’ he answered her
gaily, ‘as in Scotland you shall, despite the weepers.’</p>

<p>‘Do you go to Scotland, my lord?’</p>

<p>‘Does your Majesty?’ says he, his little eyes all of a
twinkle.</p>

<p>‘My question was first, my lord.’</p>

<p>‘And the answer to mine is the answer to your
Majesty’s.’</p>

<p>‘My Lord Democritus, am I to laugh when you leave
me?’</p>

<p>‘Why, yes, madam, rather than to lament that I outstay
my welcome.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>She showed her pleasure; at least, he saw it under the
skin. So he left her; and Mary Livingstone, as she said,
could ‘fetch her breath.’</p>

<p>Now, as to Mr. Throckmorton—if the Lord James had
desired, as assuredly he did, to get his sister to Scotland,
unwedded and in a hurry; if the Queen of England desired
it—which is certain,—neither could have used a better
means than this excellent man. The Queen was in a royal
rage when he, with great troubles and many shakings of
his obsequious head, was obliged to own the safe-conduct
through England refused. She shut herself up with her
maids, and endlessly paced the floors, avoiding their entreating
arms. They besought her to rest, to have patience,
to sit on their knees, consult her uncles of Lorraine. ‘I
shall sit in no chair, nor lie in any bed, until I am at sea,’
she promised them, and then cried: ‘What! am I a kennel-dog
to the Bastard in England?’</p>

<p>Nothing in the world should stop her. She would go to
her country by sea, and as soon as they could fit out the
galleys. And she had her way—with suspicious ease, if
she had had patience to observe it; for it happened to be
the way of three other persons vitally interested in her: the
Queen-Mother of France, who wished to get rid of her;
the Queen of England, who hoped she would get rid of
herself; and the Lord James Stuart, uncomfortably illegitimate,
who hid his designs from his own soul, and looked
at affairs without seeming to look.</p>

<p class="tb">Two galleys and four great ships took her and her
adventurous company from Calais, on a day in August of
high sun and breeze, with a misty brown bank on the horizon
where England should lie. Guns shot from the forts were
answered from the ships; to the Oriflamme of France the
Scots Queen answered with her tressured Lion, and the
English Leopards and Lilies. Of all the gallant company
embarked there was none who looked more ardently to the
north than she who was to sit in the high seat at Stirling.
Let Mary Fleming look down, and Mary Beaton raise her
eyebrows; let Mary Seton shrug and Mary Livingstone toss
her young head; they are greatly mistaken who suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
that Mary Stuart went unwillingly to Scotland, or wetted
her pillow with tears. She cried when she bade adieu to
her grandmother—tears of kindness those. But her heart
was high to be Queen, and her head full of affairs. How
she judged men! What measures she devised! Ask Mary
Livingstone whether they two slept of nights, or whether
they talked of the deeds of Queen Mary—what she should
do, what avoid, how walk, how safeguard herself. She lay
in a pavilion on the upper deck, and turned her face to
where she thought Scotland should be. But Mary Livingstone
showed Scotland her back, and sheltered her Queen
in her arms.</p>

<h3 id="I_CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="smaller">HERE YOU STEP INTO THE FOG</span></h3>

<p>Now, when they had been three days at sea, standing off
Flamborough in England, the wind veered to the southeast,
and dropped very soon. They had to row the ships
for lack of meat for the sails to fill themselves; the face of
the world was changed, the sun blotted out. It became
chilly, with a thin rain; there drew over the sea a curtain
of soft fog which wrapped them up as in a winding-sheet,
and seemed to clog the muscles of men’s backs, so that
scarcely way could be made. In this white darkness—for
such it literally was—the English took the Earl of Eglinton
in his ship, silently, without a cry to be heard; but in it
also they lost the Queen’s and all the rest of her convoy.
Rowing all night and all next day, sounding as they went
in a sea like oil, the Scots company drew past St. Abb’s,
guessed at Dunbar, found and crept under the ghost of the
Bass, came at length with dripping sheets into Leith Road
by night, and so stayed to await the morn. They fired
guns every hour; nobody slept on board.</p>

<p>That night which they began with music, some dancing
and playing forfeits, was one of deathly stillness. The
guns made riot by the clock; but the sea-fog drugged all
men’s spirits. The Queen was pensive, and broke up the
circle early. She went to bed, and lay listening, as she
said, to Scotland. As it wore towards dawn she could
have heard, if yet wakeful, great horns blown afar off on
the shore, answering her guns, the voices of men and
women, howling, quarrelling, or making merry after their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
fashion; steeple bells; sometimes the knocking of oars as
unseen boats rowed about her. Once the sentry on the
upper deck challenged: ‘Qui va là?’ in a shrill voice.
There was smothered laughter, but no other reply. He
fired his piece, and there came a great scurry in the water,
which woke the Queen with a start.</p>

<p>‘Was that the English guns? Are we engaged?’</p>

<p>‘No, no, madam; you forget. We are in our own land
by now, safe between the high hills of Scotland. ’Twas
some folly of the guard.’</p>

<p>She was told it had gone six o’clock, and insisted on
rising. Father Roche, her confessor, said mass; and after
that Mary Seton had a good tale for her private ear.
Monsieur de Bourdeilles, it seems, the merry gentleman,
had held Monsieur de Châtelard embraced against his will
under one blanket all night, to warm himself. This
Monsieur de Châtelard, a poet of some hopefulness, owned
himself Queen Mary’s lover, and played the part with an
ardour and disregard of consequence which are denied to
all but his nation. A lover is a lover, whether you admit
him or not; his position, though it be self-chosen, is
respectable: but no one could refuse the merits of this
story. Monsieur de Bourdeilles was sent for—a wise-looking,
elderly man.</p>

<p>‘Sieur de Brantôme,’ says the Queen—that was his
degree in the world—‘how did you find the warmth of
Monsieur de Châtelard?’</p>

<p>‘Upon my faith, madam,’ says he, ‘your Majesty should
know better than I did whether he is alight or not.’</p>

<p>‘I think that is true,’ said Queen Mary; ‘but now
also you will have learned, as I have, to leave him
alone.’</p>

<p class="tb">The Grand Prior—a Guise, the Queen’s uncle and a
portly man—came in to see his niece. He reported a wan
light spread abroad: one might almost suppose the sun to
be somewhere. If her Majesty extinguished the candles
her Majesty would still be able to see. It was curious.
He considered that a landing might be made, for news
of the ships was plainly come ashore. Numberless small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
boats, he said, were all about, full of people spying up at
the decks. Curious again: he had been much entertained.</p>

<p>‘You shall show yourself to them, madam, if you will
be guided by me,’ says Mary Livingstone. The Grand
Prior was not against it.</p>

<p>‘Well,’ says the Queen, ‘let us go, then, to see and be
seen.’</p>

<p>One of the maids—Seton, I gather—made an outcry:
‘Oh, ma’am, you will never go to them in your white
weed!’</p>

<p>‘How else, child?’</p>

<p>Seton caught at her hand. ‘Like the bonny Queen
Mab—like the Fairy Vivien that charmed Tamlane out of
his five wits. Thus you should go!’</p>

<p>The Queen turned blushing to the Grand Prior.</p>

<p>‘How shall I show myself, good uncle?’</p>

<p>‘My niece, you are fair enough now.’</p>

<p>‘Is it true?’ she said. ‘Then I will be fairer yet. Get
me what you will; make a queen of me. Fleming, you
shall choose.’</p>

<p>Mary Fleming, a gentle beauty, considered the case. ‘I
shall dress your Majesty in the white and green,’ she
declared, and was gone to get it.</p>

<p>So they dressed her in white and green, with a crown of
stars for her hair, and covered her in a carnation hood
against the cold. Then she was brought out among the
four of them to lean on the poop and see the people. A
half-circle of stately, cloaked gentlemen—all French, and
mainly Guises—stood behind; but Monsieur de Châtelard,
shaking like a leaf, sought the prop of a neighbouring
shoulder for his arm. It was modestly low, and belonged
to Des-Essars, the new page.</p>

<p>‘My gentle youth,’ said the poet, after thanking him for
his services, ‘I am sick because I love. Do you see that
smothered goddess? Learn then that I adore her, and so
was able to do even in the abominable arms of Monsieur
de Brantôme.’</p>

<p>‘I also consider her Majesty adorable,’ replied the page
with gravity; ‘but I do not care to say so openly.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>‘If your wound be not kept green,’ Monsieur de Châtelard
reproved him, ‘if it is covered up, it mortifies, you
bleed internally, and you die.’</p>

<p>Des-Essars bowed. ‘Why, yes, sir. There is no
difficulty in that.’</p>

<p>‘Far from it, boy—far from it! Exquisite ease, rather.’</p>

<p>‘It is true, sir,’ said Des-Essars. ‘Well! I am ready.’</p>

<p>‘And I, boy, must get ready. Soothsayers have assured
me that I shall die in that lady’s service.’</p>

<p>‘I intend to live in it,’ said Des-Essars; ‘for she chose
me to it herself.’</p>

<p>Monsieur de Châtelard considered this alternative.
‘Your intention is fine,’ he allowed; ‘but my fate is the
more piteous.’</p>

<p>Whether the people knew their Queen or not, they gave
little sign of it. They seemed to her a grudging race, unwilling
to allow you even recognition. She had been highly
pleased at first: watched them curiously, nodded, laughed,
kissed her hand to some children—who hid their faces, as
if she had put them to shame. Some pointed at her, some
shook their heads; none saluted her. Most of them looked
at the foreign servants: a great brown Gascon sailor, who
leaned half-naked against the gunwale; a black in a yellow
turban; a saucy Savoyard girl with a bare bosom; and
some, nudging others, said, ‘A priest! a priest!’—and
one, a big, wild, red-capped man, stood up in his boat,
and pointed, and cried out loud, ‘To hell with the priest!’
The cold curiosity, the uncouth drab of the scene, the raw
damp—and then this savage burst—did their work on
her. She was sensitive to weather, and quick to read
hearts. Being chilled, her own heart grew heavy. ‘I wish
to go away. They stare; there is no love here,’ she said,
and went down the companion, and sat in her pavilion
without speaking. She let Mary Livingstone take her
hand. At that hour, I know, her thought was piercingly
of France, and the sun, and the peasant girls laughing to
each other half across the breezy fields.</p>

<p>Barges came to board the Queen’s galley; strong-faced
gentlemen, muffled in cloaks, sat in the stern; all others
stood up—even the rowers, who faced forward like Venetians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
and pushed rather than pulled the slow vessels.
Running messengers kept her informed of arrivals: the
Provost of Edinburgh was come, the Captain of the Castle,
the Lord of Lethington, Maitland by name, secretary to
her mother the late Queen; her half-brothers, the Lords
James and Robert Stuart, and more—all civil, all with
stiff excuses that preparations were so backward. She
would see none but her brothers, and, at the Lord James’
desire, Mr. Secretary Maitland of Lethington. Him she
discerned to be a taut, nervous, greyish man, with a tired
face. She was prepared to like him for her mother’s sake;
but he was on his guard, unaccountably, and she too dispirited
to pursue. Des-Essars, in his <i>Secret Memoirs</i>, says
that he remembers to have noticed, young as he was, how
this Lethington’s eyes always sought those of the Lord
James before he spoke. ‘Sought,’ he says, ‘but never
found them.’ Sharply observed for a boy of fourteen.</p>

<p>Well, here was a dreary beginning, which must nevertheless
be pushed to some kind of ending. Before noon
she was landed—upon a muddy shore, the sea being at the
ebb—without cloth of estate, or tribune, or litter, with a
few halberdiers to make a way for her through a great
crowd. She looked at the ooze and slimy litter. ‘Are we
amphibians in Scotland?’ she asked her cousin D’Elbœuf.
His answer was to splash down heroically into the mess
and throw his cloak upon it. ‘Gentlemen,’ he cried out in
his own tongue, ‘make a Queen’s way!’ He had not long
to wait. A tragic cry from Monsieur de Châtelard informed
all Leith that he was wading ashore. Fine, but retarding
action! His cloak was added late to a long line of them—all
French: the Marquis’s, the Grand Prior’s, Monsieur
D’Amville’s, Monsieur de Brantôme’s, Monsieur de La
Noue’s, many more. There were competitions, encouraging
cries, great enthusiasm. The people jostled each other to
get a view; the Scots lords looked staidly on, but none
offered their cloaks.</p>

<p>Thus it was that she touched Scottish soil, as Mr.
Secretary remarked to himself, through a foreign web. A
little stone house, indescribably mean and close, was open
to her to rest in while the horses were made ready. Thither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
came certain lords—Earls of Argyll and Atholl, Lords
Erskine, Herries, and others—to kiss hands. She allowed
it listlessly, not distinguishing friend from unfriend. All
faces seemed alike to her: wooden, overbold, weathered
faces, clumsy carvings of an earlier day, with watchful,
suspicious eyes put in them to make them alive. Her ladies
were with her, and her uncles. The little room was filled
to overflowing, and in and out of the passage-ways elbowed
the French gallants shouting for their grooms. No one
was allowed to have any speech with the Queen, who sat
absorbed and unobservant in the packed assembly, a French
guard all about her, with Mary Livingstone kneeling beside
her, whispering French comfort in her ear.</p>

<p>Above the surging and the hum of the shore could be
heard the beginnings of clamour. The press at the doors
was so great they could scarcely bring up the horses;
and when the hackbutters beat them back the people
murmured. Monsieur D’Amville’s charger grew restive
and backed into the crowd: they howled at him for a
Frenchman, and were not appeased to discover by the
looks of him that he was proud of the fact. There was
much sniffing and spying for priests,—well was it for
Father Roche and his mates that, having been warned,
they lay still among the ships, intending not to land till
dusk. How was her Majesty to be got out? It seemed
that she was a prisoner. The Master of the Horse could
do nothing for his horses; the Master of the Household
was penned in the doorway. If it had not been for the
Lord James, Queen Mary must have spent the night on
the sea-shore. But the people fell back this way and that
when, bareheaded, he came out of the house. ‘Give way
there—make a place,’ he said, in a voice hardly above the
speaking tone; and way and place were made.</p>

<p>Two or three of the French lords observed him. ‘He
has the gestures of a king, look you.’</p>

<p>‘You are right; and, they tell me, a king’s desires. Do
you see that he measures them with his eye before he
speaks, as if to judge what strength he should use?’</p>

<p>They brought up the horses; the Queen came out. Up
a steep, straggling street, finally, they rode in some kind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
broken order, in a lane cut, as it were, between dumb walls
of men and women. Monsieur de Brantôme remarked to
his neighbour that it was for all the world as if travelling
mountebanks were come to town. Very few greeted her,
none seemed to satisfy any feeling but curiosity. They
pointed her out to one another. ‘Yonder she goes. See,
yonder, in the braw, cramoisy hood!’ ‘See, man, the
bonny long lass!’ ‘I mind,’ said one, ‘to have seen her
mother brought in. Just such another one.’ Some cried,
‘See you, how she arches her fine neck.’ Others, ‘She
hath the eyes of all her folk.’ ‘A dangerous smiler: a
Frenchwoman just.’</p>

<p>She did not hear these things, or did not notice them,
being slow to catch at the Scots tongue. But one wife
cried shrilly, ‘God bless that sweet face!’ and that she
recognised, and laughed her glad thanks to the kindly
soul.</p>

<p>Most eyes were drawn to the French princes, and missed
her in following them and their servants. The Grand Prior
made them wonder: his stateliness excused him the abhorred
red cross; but chief of them all seemed Monsieur de Châtelard,
very splendid in white satin and high crimson boots,
and a tall feather in his cap. Some thought he was the
Pope’s son, some the Prince of Spain come to marry the
Queen; but, ‘Havers, woman, ’tis just her mammet,’ said
one in Mary Beaton’s hearing. The Queen laughed when
this was explained to her, and remembered it for Monsieur
de Brantôme. But she only laughed those two times
between Leith shore and Holyroodhouse.</p>

<p>Her spirits mended after dinner. She held an informal
court, and set herself diligently to please and be pleased.
She desired the Lord of Lethington, in the absence of a
Lord Chamberlain, to make the presentations; he was to
stand by her side and answer all questions. He spoke her
language with a formal ease which she found agreeable,
betrayed a caustic humour now and again, was far more to
her taste than at first. She saw the old Duke of Châtelherault
and his scared son, my Lord of Arran.</p>

<p>‘Hamiltons, madam,’ said Lethington tersely, and
thought he had said all; but she had to be told that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
they claimed to stand next in blood to herself and the
throne of Scotland.</p>

<p>‘The blood has been watered, it seems to me,’ she said.
‘One can see through that old lord.’</p>

<p>‘Madam, that is his greatest grief. He cannot, if he
would, conceal his pretensions.’</p>

<p>‘Explain yourself, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Madam, you can see that he is empty. But he pretends
to fulness.’</p>

<p>‘And that white son of his, my Lord of Arran? Does
he too pretend to be full—in the head, for example?’</p>

<p>She embarrassed Mr. Secretary.</p>

<p>Mary Livingstone, at this point, came to her flushed
and urgent: ‘Madam, madam, my good father!’ A jolly
gentleman was before her, who, in the effusion of his loyalty,
forgot to kneel. ‘Your knees, my lord, your knees!’
his daughter whispered; but the fine man replied, ‘No, no,
my bairn. I stand up to fight for the Queen, and she shall
e’en see all my gear.’</p>

<p>Queen Mary, not ceremonious by nature, smiled and
was gracious: they conversed by these signs of the head
and mouth, for he had no French.</p>

<p>To go over names would be tedious, and so might have
proved to her Majesty had not Lethington fitted each
sharply with a quality. Such a man was of her Majesty’s
religion—my Lord Herries, now; such of Mr. Knox’s—see
that square-browed, frowning Lord of Lindsay. Mr.
Knox had reconciled this honourable man and his wife.
It was whispered—this for her Majesty’s ear!—that all
was not well between my Lord of Argyll and his lady,
her Majesty’s half-sister. Would Mr. Knox intervene?
At her Majesty’s desire beyond doubt he would do it.
The Duke of Châtelherault held all the west as appanage
of the Hamiltons, except a small territory round about
Glasgow, to which her Majesty’s kinsman Lennox laid
claim. The claim was faint, since the Lennox was in
England. It was supposed that fear of the Hamiltons
kept him there; but if her Majesty would be pleased she
could reconcile the two houses.</p>

<p>The Queen blinked her eyes. ‘Reconciliation seems to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
be your Mr. Knox’s prerogative. I have not yet learned
from you what mine may be.’</p>

<p>‘Yours, madam,’ said Lethington, ‘is the greater, because
gentler, hand—to put it no higher than that! Moreover,
the Stuarts of Lennox share your Majesty’s faith; and
Mr. Knox——’</p>

<p>‘Ah,’ cried the Queen, ‘I conceive your Mr. Knox is
Antipope!’</p>

<p>Mr. Secretary confessed that some had called him so.</p>

<p>‘And what does my cousin Châtelherault call him?’ she
asked.</p>

<p>He explained that the Duke paid him great respect.</p>

<p>‘Let me understand you,’ said Queen Mary. ‘The
Duke is master of the west, and Mr. Knox of the Duke.
Who is master of Mr. Knox?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, madam, he will serve your Majesty. I am sure of
him.’</p>

<p>She was not so sure: she wondered. Then she found
that she was frowning and pinching her lip, so broke into
a new line.</p>

<p>‘Let us take the south, Monsieur de Lethington. Who
prevails in those parts?’</p>

<p>He told her that there were many great men to be considered
there: my Lord Herries, my Lord Hume, the
Earl of Bothwell. This name interested her, but she was
careful not to single it out.</p>

<p>‘And is Mr. Knox the master of these?’</p>

<p>‘Not so, madam. My Lord Herries is of the old
religion; and my Lord of Bothwell——’</p>

<p>‘Does he laugh?’</p>

<p>‘I fear, madam, it is a mocking spirit.’</p>

<p>‘Why,’ says she, ‘does he laugh at Mr. Knox?’</p>

<p>Mr. Secretary detected the malice. ‘Alas! your Majesty
is pleased to laugh at her servant.’</p>

<p>‘Well, let us leave M. de Boduel to his laughter. Who
rules the north?’</p>

<p>‘The Earl of Huntly is powerful there, madam.’</p>

<p>‘I have had intelligence of him. He is a Catholic.
Well, well! And now you shall tell me, Mr. Secretary,
where my own kingdom is.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Oh, madam, it is in the hearts of your people. You
have all Scotland at your feet.’</p>

<p>‘Let us take a case. Have I, for example, your Mr.
Knox at my feet?’</p>

<p>‘Surely, madam.’</p>

<p>‘We shall see. I tell you fairly that I do not choose to
be at his. He has written against women, I hear. Is he
wed?’</p>

<p>‘Madam, he is twice a widower.’</p>

<p>‘He is severe. But he should be instructed in his
theme. He may have reason. Where is my brother?’</p>

<p>‘The Lord James is at his prayers, madam.’</p>

<p>‘I hope he will remember me there. I see that I shall
need advocacy.’</p>

<p>Her head ached, her eyes were stiff with watching.
She said her good-night and retired. At that hour there
was a great shouting and crying in the courtyard, and out
of the midst there spired a wild music of rebecks, fiddles,
scrannel-pipes, and a monstrous drum out of tune. The
French lords said, ‘Tenez, on s’amuse!’ and raised their
eyebrows. The Queen shivered over a sea-coal fire. Now
at last she remembered all fair France, saw it in one
poignant, long look inwards, and began to cry. ‘I am a
fool, a fool—but, oh me! I am wretched,’ she said, and
rocked herself about. The comfort of women—kisses,
strokings, mothering arms—was applied; they put her to
bed, and Mary Livingstone sat by her. This young
woman was in high feather, surveyed the prospect with
calmness, not at all afraid. Her father, she said, had put
before her the desires of all those gentry: he had never
had such court paid him in his long life. This it was to
be father to a maid of honour. The Duke had taken him
apart before dinner, urging the suit of his son Arran for
the Queen’s hand. The Lord James had spoken of an
earldom; Lethington could not see enough of him. ‘Hey,
my lamb,’ she ended, stroking the Queen’s hot face, ‘we
will have them all at your feet ere this time seven
days; and a lass in her teens shall sway wild Scotland!’
The Queen sighed, and snuggled her cheek into the open
hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>Just as she was dozing off there was to be heard a
scurry of feet along the corridor, the crash of a door
admitting a burst of sound—in that, the shiver of steel on
steel, a roar of voices, a loud cry above all, ‘He hath it!
He hath it!’ The Queen started up and held her heart.
‘What do they want of me? Is it Mr. Knox?’ Livingstone
ran into the antechamber among the huddling women
there. Des-Essars came to them bright-eyed to say it was
nothing. It was Monsieur D’Elbœuf fighting young
Erskine about a lady. The duel had been arranged at
supper. They had cleared the tables for the fray.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="I_CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="smaller">SUPERFICIAL PROPERTIES OF THE HONEYPOT</span></h3>

<p>When they told her what was the name Mr. Knox had
for her, and how it had been caught up by all the winds
in town, Queen Mary pinched her lip. ‘Does he call
me Honeypot? Well, he shall find there is wine in my
honey—and perchance vinegar too, if he mishandle me.
Or I may approve myself to him honey of Hymettus,
which has thyme in it, and other sane herbs to make it
sharp.’</p>

<p>A honey-queen she looked as she spoke, all golden and
rose in her white weeds, her face aflower in the close coif,
finger and thumb pinching her lip. She seemed at once
wise, wholesome, sweet, and tinged with mischief; even the
red Earl of Morton, the ‘bloat Douglas,’ as they called
him, who should have been cunning in women, when he
saw her preside at her first Council, said to his neighbour,
‘There is wine in the lass, and strong wine, to make men
drunken. What was Black James Stuart about to let her
in among us?’ It was a sign also of her suspected store
of strength that Mr. Knox was careful not to see her.
He had called her ‘Honeypot’ on hearsay.</p>

<p>No doubt she approved herself: those who loved her,
and, trembling, marked her goings, owned it to each other
by secret signs. And yet, in these early days, she stood
alone, a growing girl in a synod of elders, watching,
judging, wondering about them, praying to gods whom
they had abjured in a tongue which they had come to
detest. For they were all for England now, while she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
clung the more passionately to France. If she used
deceit, is it wonderful? The arts of women against those
half-hundred pairs of grudging, reticent eyes; a little
armoury of smiles, blushes, demure, down-drooping lids!
Was it the instinct to defend, or the relish for cajolery?
She had the art of unconscious art. She looked askance,
she let her lips quiver at a harsh decree, she kissed and
took kisses where she could. She laughed for fear she
should cry, she was witty when most at a loss. She
refused to see disapproval in any, pretended to an open
mind, and kept the inner door close-barred. Never unwatched,
she was never found out; never off the watch,
she never let her anxiety be seen. Alone she did it. Not
Mary Livingstone herself knew the half of her effort, or
shared her moments of dismay; for that whole-hearted
girl saw Scotland with Scots eyes.</p>

<p>But she succeeded—she pleased. The lords filled
Holyroodhouse, their companies the precincts; every man
was Queen Mary’s man. The city wrought at its propynes
and pageants against her entry in state. Mr. Knox, grimly
surveying the company at his board, called her Honeypot.</p>

<p>There were those of her own religion who might have
had another name for her. One morning there was a
fray after her mass, when the Lord Lindsay and a few like
him hustled and beat a priest. They waited for him
behind the screen and gave him, in their phrase, ‘a
bloody comb.’ Now, here was a case for something more
tart than honey—at least, the clerk thought so. He had
come running to her full of his griefs: the holy vessels
had been tumbled on the floor, the holy vestments were in
shreds; he (the poor ministrant) was black and blue;
martyrdom beckoned him, and so on.</p>

<p>‘Nay, good father, you shall not take it amiss,’ she
had said to him. ‘A greater than you or I said in a like
case, “<i>They know not what they do.</i>”’</p>

<p>‘Madam,’ says the priest, ‘there spake the Son of God,
all-discerning, not to be discerned of the Jews. But I
judge from the feel of my head what they do, and I think
they themselves know very well—and their master also
that sent them, their Master Knox.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I will give you another Scripture, then,’ replied she.
‘It is written, “<i>By our stripes we are healed.</i>”’</p>

<p>‘Your pardon, madam, your pardon!’ cried the priest:
‘I read it otherwise. St. Peter saith, “<i>By His stripes we
are healed</i>”—a very different matter.’</p>

<p>She grew red. ‘Come, come, sir, we are bandying
words. You will not tell me that you have no need of
heavenly physic, I suppose?’</p>

<p>‘I pray,’ said he, ‘that your Majesty have none.
Madam, if it please you, but for your Majesty’s kindred,
the Lord James and his brethren, I had been a dead man.’</p>

<p>‘You tell me the best news of my brothers I have had
yet,’ said she, and sent him away.</p>

<p>She used a gentler method with Lord Lindsay when he
next showed her his rugged, shameless face. He told her
bluntly that he would never bend the knee to Baal.</p>

<p>‘Well,’ she said, with a smile, ‘you shall bend it to me
instead.’ And she looked so winning and so young, and
withal so timid lest he should refuse, that (on a sudden
impulse) down he went before her and kissed her hand.</p>

<p>‘I knew that I could make him ashamed,’ she said afterwards
to Mary Livingstone.</p>

<p>‘I would have had him whipped!’ cried the flaming
maid.</p>

<p>‘You are out, my dear,’ said Queen Mary. ‘’Twas
better he should whip himself.’</p>

<p>Although she took enormous pains, she succeeded not
nearly so well with her bastard brothers and their sister,
Lady Argyll, the handsome, black-browed woman. James,
Robert, and John, sons of the king her father, and Margaret
Erskine, all alike tall, sable, stiff and sullen, were alike in
this too, that they were eager for what they could get
without asking. The old needy Hamilton—Duke of
Châtelherault as he was—let no day go by without
begging for his son. These men let be seen what they
wanted, but they would not ask. The vexatious thing
with their sort is, that you may give a man too much or
too little, and never be sure which of you is the robber.
Now, the Lord James greatly coveted the earldom of
Moray. Would he tell her so, think you? Not he, since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
he would not admit it to his very self. She received more
than a hint that it would be wise to reward him, and
told him that she desired it. He bowed his acceptance
as if he were obedient unto death.</p>

<p>‘Madam, if it please your Majesty to make me of your
highest estate, it is not for me to gainsay you.’</p>

<p>‘Why, no,’ says the Queen, ‘I trow it is not. You
shall be girt Earl of Mar at the Council, for such I understand
to be your present desire.’</p>

<p>It was not his desire by any means, yet he could not
bring himself to say so. Her very knowledge that he had
desires at all tied his tongue.</p>

<p>‘Madam,’ he said, sickly-white, ‘the grace is inordinate
to my merits: and, indeed, how should duty be rewarded,
being in its own performance a grateful thing? True it
is that my lands lie farther to the north than those of
Mar; true it is that in Moray—to name a case—there are
forces which, maybe, would not be the worse of a watchful
eye. But the earldom of Moray! Tush, what am I
saying?’</p>

<p>‘We spake of the earldom of Mar,’ she said drily.
‘That other, I understand, is claimed by my Lord of
Huntly, as a right of his, under my favour.’</p>

<p>He added nothing, but bit his lip sideways, and looked
at his white hands. She had done more wisely to give
him Moray at once; and so she might had he but asked
for it. But when she opened her hands he shut his up,
and where she spoke her mind he never did. She ought
to have been afraid of him, for two excellent reasons:
first, she never knew what he thought, and next, everybody
about her asked that first. Instead, he irritated her,
like a prickly shift.</p>

<p>‘Am I to knock for ever at the shutters of the house of
him?’ she asked of her friends. ‘Not so, but I shall
conclude there is nobody at home.’</p>

<p>Healthy herself, and high-spirited, and as open as the
day when she was in earnest, she laughed at his secret
ways in private and made light of them in public. It was
on the tip of her saucy tongue more than once or twice to
strike him to earth with the thunderbolt: ‘Did you hasten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
me to Scotland to work my ruin, brother? Do you reckon
to climb to the throne over me?’ She thought better of
it, but only because it seemed not worth her while. There
was no give-and-take with the Lord James, and it is dull
work whipping a dead dog.</p>

<p>Meantime the prediction of Mary Livingstone seemed
on the edge of fulfilment. Queen Mary ruled Scotland;
and her spirits rose to meet success. She was full of
courage and good cheer, holding her kingdom in the hollow
of her palms. Honeypot? Did Mr. Knox call her so?
It was odd how the name struck her.</p>

<p>‘Well,’ she said, with a shrug, ‘if they find me sweet
and hive about me, shall I not do well?’</p>

<p>She made Lethington Secretary of State without
reserve, and remarked that he was every day in the antechamber.</p>

<p>The word flew busily up and down the Canongate,
round about the Cross: ‘Master Knox hath fitted her
with a name, do you mind? “She is Honeypot,” quoth
he. Heard you ever the like o’ that?’ Some favoured it
and her, some winked at it, some misfavoured; and these
were the grey beards and white mutches. But one and
all came out to see her make her entry on the Tuesday.</p>

<p class="tb">One hour before she left Holyrood, Mr. Knox preached
from his window in the High Street to a packed assembly
of blue bonnets and shrouded heads, upon the text, <i>Be
wise now therefore, O ye Kings</i>—a ring of scornful despair
in his accents making the admonition vain. ‘I shall not
ask ye now what it is ye are come out for to see, lest
I tempt ye to lie; for I know better than yourselves.
Meat! “Give us meat,” ye cry and clamour; “give us
meat for the gapes, meat for greedy eyes!” Ay, and ye
shall have your meat, fear not for that. Jags and slashes
and feathered heads, ye shall have; targeted tails, and
bosoms decked in shame, but else as bare as my hand.
Fill yourselves with the like of these—but oh, sirs, when
ye lie drunken, blame not the kennel that holds ye. If
that ye crave to see prancing Frenchmen before ye, minions
and jugglers, leaping sinners, damsels with timbrels, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
such-like sick ministers to sick women’s desires, I say, let
it be so, o’ God’s holy name; for the day cometh when ye
shall have grace given ye to look within, and see who
pulls the wires that sets them all heeling and reeling,
jigging up and down—whether Christ or Antichrist,
whether the Lord God of Israel or the Lord Mammon
of the Phœnicians. Look ye well in that day, judge ye
and see.’</p>

<p>He stopped, as if he saw in their midst what he cried
against; and some man called up, ‘What more will you
say, sir?’</p>

<p>Mr. Knox gathered himself together. ‘Why, this, my
man, that the harlotry of old Babylon is not dead yet, but
like a snake lifteth a dry head from the dust wherein you
think to have crushed her. Bite, snake, bite, I say; for
the rather thou bitest, the rather shall thy latter end come.
Heard ye not, sirs, how they trounced a bare-polled priest
in the house of Rimmon, before the idol of abomination
herself, these two days by past? I praise not, I blame not;
I say, him that is drunken let him be drunken still. More
becomes me not as yet, for all is yet to do. I fear to prejudge,
I fear to offend; let us walk warily, brethren, until
the day break. But I remember David, ruler in Israel,
when he hoped against hope and knew not certainly that
his cry should go up as far as God. For no more than
that chosen minister can I look to see the number of the
elect made up from a froward and stiff-necked generation.
Nay, but I can cry aloud in the desert, I can fast, I can
watch for the cloud of the gathering wrath of God. And
this shall be my prayer for you and for yours, <i>Be wise, etc.</i>’
He did pray as he spoke, with his strong eyes lifted up
above the housetops—a bidding prayer, you may call it, to
which the people’s answer rumbled and grew in strength.
One or two in the street struck into a savage song, and
soon the roar of it filled the long street:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>A gun in the valley told them that the Queen was away.
It was well that she was guarded.</p>

<p>Des-Essars, the Queen’s French page, in that curious
work of his, half reminiscence and half confession, which he
dubs <i>Le Secret des Secrets</i>, has a note upon this day, and
the aspect of the crowd, which he says was dangerous.
‘Looking up the hill,’ he writes, ‘towards the Netherbow
Port, where we were to stop for the ceremony of the keys,
I could see that the line of sightseers was uneven, ever
surging and ebbing like an incoming sea. Also I had no
relish for the faces I saw—I speak not of them at the
windows. Certainly, all were highly curious to see my
mistress and their own; and yet—or so I judged—they
found in her and her company food for the eyes and none
for the heart. They appeared to consider her their property;
would have had her go slow, that they might fill
themselves with her sight; or fast, that they might judge
of her horsemanship. We were a show, forsooth; not come
in to take possession of our own; rather admitted, that
these close-lipped people might possess us if they found us
worthy—ah, or dispossess us if they did not. Here and
there men among them hailed their favourites: the Lord
James Stuart was received with bonnets in the air; and at
least once I heard it said, “There rides the true King of
Scots.” My Lord Chancellor Morton, riding immediately
before the Queen’s Grace, did not disdain to bandy words
with them that cried out upon him, “The Douglas! The
Douglas!” He, looking round about, “Ay, ye rascals,” I
heard him say, “ye know your masters fine when they
carry the sword.” He was a very portly, hearty gentleman
in those days, high-coloured, with a full round beard. But
above all things in the world the Scots lack fineness of
manners. It was not that this Earl of Morton desired to
grieve the Queen by any freedom of his; but worse than
that, to my thinking, he did not know that he did it. As
for my lords her Majesty’s uncles, their reception was
exceedingly unhappy; but they cared little for that.
Foolish Monsieur de Châtelard made matters worse by
singing like a boy in quire as he rode behind his master,
Monsieur d’Amville. This he did, as he said, to show his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
contempt for the rabble; but all the result was that he
earned theirs. I saw a tall, gaunt, bearded man at a
window, in a black cloak and bonnet. They told me that
was Master Knox, the strongest man in Scotland.’</p>

<p>It is true that Master Knox watched the Queen go up,
with sharp eyes which missed nothing. He saw her eager
head turn this way and that at any chance of a welcome.
He saw her meet gladness with gladness, deprecate doubt,
plead for affection. ‘Out of the strong came forth sweetness:
but she is too keen after sweet food.’ She smiled all
the while, but with differences which he was jealous to note.
‘She deals carefully; she is no so sure of her ground. Eh,
man, she goes warily to work.’</p>

<p>A child at a window leaped in arms and called out
clearly: ‘Oh, mother, mother, the braw leddy!’ The
Queen laughed outright, looked up, nodded, and kissed
her hand.</p>

<p>‘Hoots, woman,’ grumbled Mr. Knox, ‘how ye lick your
fingers! Fie, what a sweet tooth ye have!’</p>

<p>She was very happy, had no doubts but that, as she won
the Keys of the Port, she should win the hearts of all these
people. Stooping down, she let the Provost kiss her hand.
‘The sun comes in with me, tell the Provost,’ she said to
Mr. Secretary, not trusting her Scots.</p>

<p>‘Madam, so please you,’ the good man replied, clearing
his throat, ‘we shall make a braver show for your Grace’s
contentation upon the coming out from dinner. Rehearse
that to her Majesty, Lethington, I’ll trouble ye.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, Mr. Provost, we shall all make a better show then,
trust me,’ she said, laughing; and rode quickly through
the gate.</p>

<p>She was very bold: everybody said that. She had the
manners of a boy—his quick rush of words, his impulse,
and his dashing assurance—with that same backwash of
timidity, the sudden wonder of ‘Have I gone too far—betrayed
myself’ which flushes a boy hot in a minute.
All could see how bold she was; but not all knew how the
heart beat. It made for her harm that her merits were shy
things. I find that she was dressed for the day in ‘a stiff
white satin gown sewn all over with pearls.’ Her neck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
was bare to the cleft of the bosom; and her tawny brown
hair, curled and towered upon her head, was crowned with
diamonds. Des-Essars says that her eyes were like stars;
but he is partial. There were many girls in Scotland fairer
than she. Mary Fleming was one, a very gentle, modest
lady; Mary Seton was another, sharp and pure as a profile
on a coin of Sicily. Mary Livingstone bore herself like a
goddess; Mary Beaton had a riper lip. But this Mary
Stuart stung the eyes, and provoked by flashing contrasts.
Queen of Scots and Dryad of the wood; all honey and
wine; bold as a boy and as lightly abashed, clinging as a
girl and as slow to leave hold, full of courage, very wise.
‘Sirs, a dangerous sweet woman. Here we have the
Honeypot,’ says Mr. Knox to himself, and thought of
her at night.</p>

<p>After dinner, as she came down the hill, they gave her
pageants. Virgins in white dropped out of machines with
crowns for her; blackamoors, Turks, savage men came
about her with songs about the Scriptures and the fate of
Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. She understood some, and
laughed pleasantly at all. Even she took not amiss the
unmannerly hint of the Lawn Market, where they would
have burned a mass-priest in effigy—had him swinging
over the faggots, chalice and vestment, crucifix and all.
‘Fie, sirs, fie! What harm has he done, poor soul?’ was
all she said.</p>

<p>The Grand Prior was furiously angry; seeing which,
the Earl of Morton cut the figure down, and then struck
out savagely with the flat of his blade, spurring his horse
into the sniggering mob. ‘Damn you, have done with
your beastliness—down, dogs, down!’ The Lord James
looked away.</p>

<p>At the Salt Tron they had built up a door, with a glory
as of heaven upon it. Here she dismounted and sat for a
while. Clouds above drew apart; a pretty boy in a gilt
tunic was let down by ropes before her. He said a piece
in gasps, then offered her the Psalter in rhymed Scots.
She thought it was the Geneva Bible, and took it with a
queer lift of the eyebrows, which all saw. Arthur Erskine,
to whom she handed it, held it between finger and thumb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
as if it had been red hot; and men marked that, and
nudged each other. The boy stood rigid, not knowing
what else to do; quickly she turned, looked at him shyly
for a moment, then leaned forward and took him up in her
arms, put her cheek to his, cuddled and kissed him. ‘You
spake up bravely, my lamb,’ she said. ‘And what may
your name be?’ She had to look up to Lethington for
his reply, but did not let go of the child. His name was
Ninian Ross. ‘I would I had one like you, Ninian Ross!’
she cried in his own tongue, kissed him again, and let him
go.</p>

<p>People said to each other, ‘She loves too much, she is
too free of her loving—to kiss and dandle a bairn in the
street.’</p>

<p>‘Honeypot, Honeypot!’ said grudging Mr. Knox,
looking on rapt at all this.</p>

<p>Des-Essars writes: ‘She believed she had won the entry
of the heart; she read in the castle guns, bells of steeples,
and hoarse outcry of the crowd, assurance of what she
hoped for. I was glad, for my part, and disposed to thank
God heartily, that we reached Holyroodhouse without
injury to her person or insult to cut her to the soul.’</p>

<p>I think Des-Essars too sensitive: she was fully as
shrewd an observer as he could have been. At least, she
returned in good spirits. If any were tired, she was not;
but danced all night with her Frenchmen. Monsieur de
Châtelard was a happy man when he had her in his arms.</p>

<p>‘Miséricorde—O Queen of Love! Thus I would go
through the world, though I burned in hell for it after.’</p>

<p>‘Thus would not I,’ quoth she. ‘You are hurting me.
Take care.’</p>

<p>They brought her news in the midst that the Earl of
Bothwell was in town with a great company, and would
kiss her hands in the morning if he might.</p>

<p>‘Let him come to me now while I am happy,’ she said.
‘Who knows what to-morrow may do for me?’</p>

<p>She sent away Châtelard, and waited. Soon enough
she saw the Earl’s broad shoulders making a way, the
daring eyes, the hardy mouth. ‘You are welcome, my
lord, to Scotland.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>‘But am I welcome to your Majesty?’</p>

<p>‘You have been slow to seek my welcome, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Madam, I have been slow to believe it.’</p>

<p>‘You need faith, Monsieur de Boduel.’</p>

<p>‘I wish that your Majesty did!’</p>

<p>‘Why so?’</p>

<p>‘That your Majesty might partake of mine.’</p>

<p>They chopped words for half an hour or more. But she
had her match in him.</p>

<p>She was friends with all the world that night, or tried
to think so. Yet, at the going to bed, when the lights
were out, the guards posted, and state-rooms empty save
for the mice, she came up to Mary Livingstone and stroked
her face without a word, coaxing for assurance of her
triumph. Wanting it still—for the maid was glum—she
supplied it for herself. ‘We rule all Scotland, my dear,
we rule all Scotland!’</p>

<p>But Mary Livingstone held up her chin, to be out of
reach of that wheedling hand. Coldly, or as coldly as
she might, she looked at the eager face, and braved the
glimmering eyes.</p>

<p>‘Ay,’ she said, ‘ay, you do. You and John Knox
betwixt you.’</p>

<p>The Queen laughed. ‘Shall I marry Mr. Knox? He
is twice a widower.’</p>

<p>‘He would wed you the morn’s morn if you would have
him,’ says Livingstone. ‘’Tis a fed horse, that Knox.’</p>

<p>‘He feeds on wind, I think,’ the Queen said; and the
maid snorted, implacable.</p>

<p>‘’Tis a better food than your Earl of Bothwell takes, to
my mind.’</p>

<p>‘And what is his food?’</p>

<p>‘The blood of women and their tears,’ said Mary
Livingstone.</p>

<span class="smaller">ROUGH MUSIC HERE</span></h3>

<p>The Earl of Huntly came to town, with three tall sons,
three hundred Gordons, and his pipers at quickstep before
him, playing, ‘Cock o’ the North.’ He came to seek the
earldom of Moray, a Queen’s hand for his son George, and
to set the realm’s affairs on a proper footing; let Mr. Knox
and his men, therefore, look to themselves. His three sons
were George, John, and Adam. George, his eldest, was
Lord Gordon, with undoubted birthrights; but John of Findlater,
so called, was his dearest, and should have married
the Queen if he had not been burdened with a stolen
wife in a tower, whom he would not put out of his head
while her husband was alive. So George must have the
Queen, said Huntly. That once decided, his line was clear.
‘Madam, my cousin,’ he intended to say, ‘I give you all
Scotland above the Highland line in exchange for your
light hand upon the South. Straighter lad or cleanlier
built will no maid have in the country, nor appanage so
broad. Is it a match?’ Should it not be a match, indeed?
Both Catholics, both sovereign rulers, both young, both
fine imps. If she traced her descent from Malcolm Canmore,
he got his from Gadiffer, who, as every one knows,
was the brother of Perceforest, whose right name was Betis,
whose ancestor was Brutus’ self, whose root was fast in
Laomedon, King of Troy. ‘The boy and girl were born
for each other,’ said Huntly. So he crossed the Forth at
Stirling Brig, and marched down through the green lowland
country like a king, with colours to the wind and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
pipes screaming his hopes and degree in the world. But
he came slowly because of his unwieldy size. He was
exceedingly fat, white-haired and white-bearded, and had
a high-coloured, windy, passionate face, flaming blue eyes,
and a husky voice, worn by shrieking at his Gordons.
Such was the old Earl of Huntly, the star of whose house
was destined to make fatal conjunctions with Queen Mary’s.</p>

<p>His entry into Edinburgh began at the same rate of
pomp, but ended in the screaming of men whose pipes
were slit. There were Hamiltons in the city, Hepburns,
Murrays, Keiths, Douglases, red-haired Campbells. The
close wynds vomited armed men at every interchange of
civilities on the cawsey; a match to the death could be
seen at any hour in the tilt-yard; the chiefs stalked grandly
up and down before their enemies’ houses, daring one
another do their worst. It seemed that only Huntly and
his Gordons had been wanting to set half Scotland by the
ears. The very night of their incoming young John of
Findlater spied his enemy Ogilvy—the husband of the
stolen wife—walking down the Luckenbooths arm-in-arm
with his kinsman Boyne. He stepped up in front of him,
lithe as an otter, and says he, ‘Have I timed my coming
well, Mr. Ogilvy?’ Ogilvy, desperate of his wife, may be
excused for drawing upon him; and (the fray once begun)
you cannot blame John Gordon of Findlater for killing him
clean, or Ogilvy of Boyne for wounding John of Findlater.
Hurt as he was, the young man was saved by his friends.
Little he cared for the summons of slaughter sued out
against him in the morning, with his enemy dead and three
hundred Gordons to keep his doors.</p>

<p>The Earl his father treated the affair as so much thistledown
thickening the wind; but his own performances were
as exorbitant as his proposals. He quarrelled with the
high Lord James Stuart about precedence. Flicking his
glove in the sour face, ‘Hoots, my lord, you are too new
an Earl to take the gate of me,’ he said. He assumed the
title of Moray—which was what he had come to beg for—in
addition to his own. ‘She dare not refuse me, man. It
is well known I have the lands.’ The Lord James turned
stately away at this hearing, and Huntly ruffled past him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
into the presence, muttering as he went, ‘A king’s mischance,
my sakes!’ He had a fine command of scornful
nicknames; that was one of them. He called Mr. Secretary
Lethington the Grey Goose—no bad name for a
tried gentleman whose tone was always symptomatic of
his anxieties. The Earl of Bothwell was a ‘Jack-Earl,’ he
said; but Bothwell laughed at him. The Duke and his
Hamiltons were ‘Glasgow tinklers’; the Earl of Morton,
‘Flesher Morton.’ His pride, indeed, seemed to be of
that inordinate sort which will not allow a man to hate his
equals. He hated whole races of less-descended men; he
hated burgesses, Forbeses, Frenchmen, Englishmen; but
his peers he despised. Catholic as he was, he went to the
preaching at Saint Giles’ in a great red cloak, wearing his
hat, and stood apart, clacking with his tongue, while Mr.
Knox thundered out prophecies. ‘Let yon bubbly-jock
bide,’ he told his son, who was with him. ‘’Tis a congested
rogue, full of bad wind. What! Give him vent, man, and
see him poison the whole assembly.’ Mr. Knox denounced
him to his face as a Prophet of the Grove, and bid him cry
upon his painted goddess. The great Huntly tapped his
nose, then the basket of his sword, and presently strode
out of church by a way which his people made for him.</p>

<p>Queen Mary was amused with the large, boisterous,
florid man, and very much admired his sons. They were
taller than the generality of Scots, sanguine, black-haired,
small-headed, with the intent far gaze in their grey eyes
which hawks have, and all dwellers in the open. She saw
but two of them, the eldest and the youngest—for John of
Findlater, having slain his man, lay at home—and set herself
to work to break down their shy respect. For their
sakes she humoured their preposterous father; allowed,
what all her court was at swords drawn against, that his
pipers should play him into her presence; listened to what
he had to say about Gadiffer, brother of Perceforest, about
Knox and his ravings, about the loyal North. He expanded
like a warmed bladder, exhibited his sons’ graces as if he
were a horsedealer, openly hinted at his proposals in her
regard. She needed none of his nods and winks, being
perfectly well able to read him, and of judgment perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
clear upon the inflated text. In private she laughed it
away. ‘I think my Lord of Gordon a very proper gentleman,’
she said to Livingstone; ‘but am I to marry the first
long pair of legs I meet with? Moreover, I should have to
woo him, for he fears me more than the devil. Yet it is a
comely young man. I believe him honest.’</p>

<p>‘The only Gordon to be so, then,’ said Livingstone
tersely. This was the prevailing belief: ‘False as Gordon.’</p>

<p>Then came Ogilvy of Boyne and his friends before
the council, demanding the forfeiture of John Gordon of
Findlater for slaughter. Old Huntly pished and fumed.
‘What! For pecking the feathers out of a daw! My fine
little man, you and your Ogilvys should keep within your
own march. You meet with men on the highways.’ The
young Queen, isolated on her throne above these angry
men, looked from one to another faltering. Suddenly she
found that she could count certainly upon nobody. Her
brother James had kept away; the Earl of Bothwell was
not present; my Lord Morton the Chancellor blinked a pair
of sleepy eyes upon the scene at large. ‘Let the law take
its course,’ she faintly said; and old Huntly left the chamber,
sweeping the Ogilvys out of his road. That was no
way to get the Earldom of Moray and a royal daughter-in-law
into one’s family. He himself confessed that the
time had come for serious talk with the Queen.</p>

<p>Even this she bore, knowing him Catholic and believing
him honest. When, after some purparley, at a privy
audience, he came to what he called ‘close quarters,’
and spoke his piece about holy church, sovereign rulers,
and fine imps, she laughed still, it is true, but more
shrewdly than before. ‘Not too fast, my good lord, not
too fast. I approve of my Lord Gordon, and should come
thankfully to his wedding. Yet I should be content with
a lowlier office there than you seem to propose me. And
if he come to <i>my</i> wedding, I hope he will bring his lady.’
She turned to the Secretary. ‘Tell my lord, Mr. Secretary,
what other work is afoot.’</p>

<p>Hereupon Lethington enlarged upon royal marriages,
their nature and scope, and flourished styles and titles
before the mortified old man. He spoke of the Archduke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Ferdinand, that son of Cæsar; of Charles the Most
Christian King, a boy in years, but a very forward boy.
He dwelt freely and at length upon King Philip’s son of
Spain, Don Carlos, a magnificent young man. Mostly he
spoke of the advantage there would be if his royal mistress
should please to walk hand in hand with her sister of
England in this affair. Surely that were a lovely vision!
The hearts of two realms would be pricked to tears by the
spectacle—two great and ancient thrones, each stained
with the blood of the other, flowering now with two roses,
the red and the white! The blood-stains all washed out
by happy tears—ah, my good lord, and by the kisses of
innocent lips! It were a perilous thing, it were an unwarrantable
thing, for one to move without the other.
‘I speak thus freely, my Lord of Huntly,’ says Lethington,
warming to the work, ‘that ye may see the whole mind of
my mistress, her carefulness, and how large a field her new-scaled
eyes must take in. This is not a business of knitting
North to South. She may trust always to the affection of
her subjects to tie so natural a bond. Nay, but the comforting
of kingdoms is at issue here. Ponder this well, my
lord, and you will see.’</p>

<p>The Earl of Huntly was crimson in the face. ‘I do see,
madam, how it is, that my house shall have little tenderness
from your Majesty’s’—he was very angry. ‘I see
that community of honour, community of religion count
for nothing. Foh! My life and death upon it!’ He
puffed and blew, glaring about him; then burst out again.
‘I will pay my thanks for this where they are most due.
I know the doer—I spit upon his deed. Who is that man
that cometh creeping after my earldom? Who looketh
aslant at all my designs? Base blood stirreth base work.
Who seeketh the life of my fine son?’</p>

<p>The Queen flushed. ‘Stay, sir,’ she said, ‘I cannot
hear you. You waste words and honour alike.’</p>

<p>He shook his head at her, as if she were a naughty
child; raised his forefinger, almost threatened. ‘Madam,
madam, your brother James——’</p>

<p>She got up, the fire throbbing in her. ‘Be silent, my
lord!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Madam——’</p>

<p>‘Be silent.’</p>

<p>‘But, madam——’</p>

<p>Lethington, much agitated, whispered in her ear; she
shook him away, stamped, clenched her hands.</p>

<p>‘You are dismissed, sir. The audience is finished. Do
you hear me?’</p>

<p>‘How finished? How finished?’</p>

<p>‘Go, go, my lord, for God’s sake!’ urged the Secretary.</p>

<p>‘A pest!’ cried he, and fumed out of the Castle.</p>

<p>She rode down the Canongate to dinner that day at
a hand-gallop, the people scouring to right and left to be
clear of heels. Her colour was bright and hot, her hair
streamed to the wind. ‘Fly, fly, fly!’ she cried, and
whipped her horse. ‘A hateful fool, to dare me so!’
Lethington, Argyll, James her brother, came clattering
and pounding behind. ‘She is fey! She is fey! She
rides like a witch!’ women said to one another; but Mr.
Knox, who saw her go, said to himself, ‘She is nimble as
a boy.’ Publicly—since this wild bout made a great commotion
in men’s thoughts—he declared, ‘If there be not
in her a proud mind, a crafty wit, and an indurate heart
against God and His truth, my judgment faileth me.’
Neither he nor his judgments were anything to her in
those days; she heard little of his music, rough or not.
And yet, just at that time, had she sent for him she could
have won him for ever. ‘Happy for her,’ says Des-Essars,
writing after the event, ‘thrice happy for her if she had!
For I know very well—and she knew it also afterwards—that
the man was in love with her.’</p>

<p>At night, having recovered herself, she was able to
laugh with the maids at old Huntly, and to look with kind
eyes upon the graces of his son Gordon.</p>

<p>‘If I cared to do it,’ she said, ‘I could have that young
man at my feet. But I fear he is a fool like his father.’</p>

<p>She tried him: he danced stiffly, talked no French, and
did not know what to do with her hand when he had it,
or with his own either. She sparkled, she glittered before
him, smiled at his confusion, encouraged him by softness,
befooled him. It was plain that he was elated; but she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
held her own powers so lightly, and thought so little of
his, that she had no notion of what she was doing—to
what soaring heights she was sending him. When she
had done with him, a strange tremor took the young lord—a
fixed, hard look, as if he saw something through the
wall.</p>

<p>‘What you see? What you fear, my lord?’ she stammered
in her pretty Scots.</p>

<p>‘I see misfortune, and shame, and loss. I see women at
the loom—a shroud for a man—hey, a shroud, a shroud!’
He stared about at all the company, and at her, knowing
nobody. Slowly recovering himself, he seemed to scrape
cobwebs from his face. ‘I have drunk knowledge this
night, I think.’</p>

<p>She plumbed the depth of his case. ‘Go now, my lord;
leave me, now.’</p>

<p>‘One last word to you, madam, with my face to your
face.’</p>

<p>‘What would you say to me?’</p>

<p>He took her by the hand, with more strength than she
had believed in him. ‘Trust Gordon,’ he said, and left
her.</p>

<p>‘I shall believe your word,’ she called softly after him,
‘and remember it.’</p>

<p>He lifted his hand, but made no other sign; he carried
a high head through the full hall, striding like a man
through heather, not to be stopped by any.</p>

<p>She thought that she had never seen a prouder action.
He went, carrying his devotion, like a flag into battle.
Beside him the Earl of Bothwell looked a pirate, and
Châtelherault a pantaloon.</p>

<p>‘He deserves a fair wife, for he would pleasure her well,’
she considered; then laughed softly to herself, and shook
her head. ‘No, no, not for me—such a dreamer as that.
I should direct his dreams—I, who need a man.’</p>

<p>That pirate Earl of Bothwell used a different way. He
bowed before her the same night, straightened his back
immediately, and looked her full in the face. No fear
that this man would peer through walls for ghosts!
She was still tender from the thoughts of her young Highlander;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
but you know that she trusted this bluff ally, and
was not easily offended by honest freedoms. She had
seen gallants of his stamp in France.</p>

<p>‘Pleasure and good answers to your Grace’s good desires,’
he laughed.</p>

<p>She looked wisely up at him, keeping her mouth
demure.</p>

<p>‘Monsieur de Boduel, you shall lead me to dance if you
will.’</p>

<p>‘Madam, I shall.’ He took her out with no more ceremony,
and acquitted himself gaily: a good dancer, and
very strong, as she had already discovered. What arms
to uphold authority! What nerve to drive our rebels into
church! Ah, if one need a man!...</p>

<p>She asked him questions boldly. ‘What think you, my
lord, of the Earl of Huntly?’</p>

<p>‘Madam, a bladder, holding a few pease. Eh, and he
rattles when you do shake him! Prick him, he is gone;
but the birds will flock about for the seeds you scatter.
They are safer where they lie covered, I consider.’</p>

<p>She followed this. ‘I would ask you further. There
is here a remarkable Mr. Knox: what am I to think of
him?’</p>

<p>He stayed awhile, stroking his beard, before he shrugged
in the French manner, that is, with the head and eyebrow.</p>

<p>‘In Rome, madam, we doff caps to the Pope. I am
friendly with Mr. Knox. He is a strong man.’</p>

<p>‘As Samson was of old?’</p>

<p>He laughed freely. ‘Oh, my faith, madam, Delilah is
not awanting. There’s a many and many.’</p>

<p>She changed the subject. ‘They tell me that you are
of the religion, Monsieur de Boduel, but I am slow to
believe that. In France I remember——’</p>

<p>‘Madam,’ says he, ‘my religion is one thing, my philosophy
another. Let us talk of the latter. There is one
God in a great cloud; but the world, observe, is many-sided.
Sometimes, therefore, the cloud is rent towards the
south; and the men of the south say, “Behold! our God
is hued like a fire.” Or if, looking up, they see the sun
pale in a fog, with high faith they say one to another,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
“Yonder white disc, do you mark, that is the Son of God.”
Sometimes also your cloud is parted towards the north.
Then cry the men of those parts, “Lo! our God, like a
snow-mountain!” Now, when I am in the south I see
with the men of the south, for I cannot doubt all the
dwellers in the land; but when I am in the north, likewise
I say, There is something in what you report. So much
for philosophy—to which Religion, with a rod in hand, cries
out: “You fool, you fool! God is neither there nor here;
but He is in the heart.” There you have it, madam.’</p>

<p>She bowed gravely. ‘I have heard the late king, my
father-in-law, say the same to Madame de Valentinois;
and she agreed with him, as she always did in such matters.
It is a good thought. But in whose heart do you place
God? Not in all?’</p>

<p>‘In a good heart, madam. In a crowned heart.’</p>

<p>‘The crowned heart,’ said she, ‘is the Douglas badge.
Do you place Him then in the heart of Monsieur de
Morton?’</p>

<p>This tickled him, but he felt it also monstrous. ‘God
forbid me! No, no, madam. Douglas wears it abroad—not
always with credit. But the crowned heart was the
heart of the Bruce.’</p>

<p>She was pleased; the sudden turn warmed her. ‘You
spoke that well, and like a courtier, my lord.’</p>

<p>‘Madam,’ he cried, covering his own heart, ‘that is what
I would always do if I had the wit. For I am a courtier
at this hour.’</p>

<p>Pondering this in silence, she suffered him to lead her
where he would; and took snugly to bed with her the
thought that, in her growing perplexities, she had a sure
hand upon hers when she chose to call for it.</p>

<p class="tb">As for him, Bothwell, he must have gone directly from
this adventure in the tender to play his bass in some of
the roughest music of those days. That very night—and
for the third time—he, with D’Elbœuf and Lord John
Stuart, went in arms, with men and torches, to Cuthbert
Ramsay’s house, hard by the Market Cross; and, being
refused as before, this time made forceful entry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>To the gudeman’s ‘What would ye with me, sirs, good
lack?’ they demanded sight of Alison, his handsome
daughter, now quaking in her bed by her man’s side; and
not sight only, but a kiss apiece for the sake of my Lord
Arran. She was, by common report, that lord’s mistress—but
the fact is immaterial.</p>

<p>‘Come down with me, man—stand by me in this hour,’
quoth she.</p>

<p>But her husband plainly refused to come. ‘Na, na, my
woman, thou must thole the assize by thysel’,’ said the
honest fellow.</p>

<p>She donned her bedgown, tied up her hair, and was
brought down shamefast by her father.</p>

<p>‘Do me no harm, sirs, do me no harm!’</p>

<p>‘Less than your braw Lord of Arran,’ says Bothwell,
and took the firstfruits.</p>

<p>The low-roofed parlour full of the smoke of torches,
flaring lights, wild, unsteady gentlemen in short cloaks,
flushed Alison in the midst—one can picture the scene.
The ceremony was prolonged; there were two nights’ vigil
to be made up. On a sudden, half-way to the girl’s cold
lips, Lord Bothwell stops, looks sidelong, listens.</p>

<p>‘The burgh is awake. Hark to that! Gentlemen, we
must draw off.’</p>

<p>They hear cries in the street, men racing along the
flags. From the door below one calls, ‘The Hamiltons!
Look to yourselves! The Hamiltons!’</p>

<p>Almost immediately follows a scuffle, a broken oath,
the ‘Oh, Christ!’ and fall of a man. Lord Bothwell
regards his friends—posterior parts of three or four craning
out of window, D’Elbœuf tying up his points, John
Stuart dancing about the floor. ‘Gentlemen, come
down.’</p>

<p>He wrapped his cloak round his left arm, whipped out
his blade, and went clattering down the stair. The others
came behind him. From the passage they heard the fighting;
from the door, as they stood spying there, the whole
town seemed a roaring cave of men. Through and above
the din they could catch the screaming of Lord Arran,
choked with rage, tears, and impotence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Who is the doxy, I shall ask ye: Arran or the lass?’
says Bothwell, making ready to rush the entry.</p>

<p>Just as he cleared the door he was stabbed by a dirk in
the upper arm, and felt the blood go from him. All Edinburgh
seemed awake—a light in every window and a
woman to hold it. Hamiltons and their friends packed
the street: some twenty Hepburns about Ramsay’s door
kept their backs to the wall. For a time there was great
work.</p>

<p>In the midst of the hubbub they heard the pipes skirling
in the Cowgate.</p>

<p>‘Here comes old Huntly from his lodging,’ says Lord
John to his neighbour. This was Bothwell, engaged with
three men at the moment, and in a gay humour.</p>

<p>‘Ay, hark to him!’ he called over his shoulder; and
then, purring like some fierce cat, ‘Softly now—aha, I
have thee, friend!’ and ran one of his men through the
body.</p>

<p>The pipes blew shrilly, close at hand, the Gordons
plunged into the street. Led by their chief, by John of
Findlater and Adam (a mere boy), they came rioting into
battle.</p>

<p>‘Aboyne! Aboyne! Watch for the Gordon!’—they
held together and clove through the massed men like a bolt.</p>

<p>‘Hold your ground! I’ll gar them give back!’ cried
old Huntly; and Bothwell, rallying his friends, pushed out
to meet him: if he had succeeded the Hamiltons had been
cut in two. As it was, the fighting was more scattered,
the <i>mêlée</i> broken up; and this was the state of affairs
when the Lord James chose to appear with a company of
the Queen’s men from the Castle.</p>

<p>For the Lord James, in his great house at the head of
Peebles Wynd—awake over his papers when all the world
was asleep or at wickedness—had heard the rumours of
the fight; and then, even while he considered it, heard the
Gordons go by. He heard old Huntly encouraging his
men, heard John of Findlater: if he had needed just
advantage over his scornful enemy he might have it now.
He got up from his chair and stood gazing at his papers,
rubbing together his soft white hands. Anon he went to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
the closet, awoke his servant, and bade him make ready
for the street. Cloaked, armed and bonneted, followed by
the man, he went by silent ways to the Castle.</p>

<p>When he came upon the scene of the fray, he found
John Gordon of Findlater at grapple with a Hamilton
amid a litter of fallen men. He found Adam Gordon pale
by the wall, wounded, smiling at his first wound. He
could not find old Huntly, for he was far afield, chasing
men down the wynds. D’Elbœuf had slipped away on
other mischief, Bothwell (with a troublesome gash) had
gone home to bed. He saw Arran battering at Ramsay’s
door, calling on his Alison to open to him—and left the
fool to his folly. It was Huntly he wanted, and, failing
him, took what hostages he could get. He had John of
Findlater pinioned from behind, young Adam from before,
and the pair sent off guarded to the Castle.</p>

<p>To Arran, then, who ceased not his lamentations, he
sternly said, ‘Fie, my lord, trouble not for such a jade at
such an hour; but help me rather to punish the Queen’s
enemies.’</p>

<p>Arran turned upon him, pouring out his injuries in a
stream.</p>

<p>The Lord James listened closely: so many great names
involved! Ah, the Earl of Bothwell! Alas, my lord,
rashness and vainglory are hand-in-hand, I fear. The
Marquis D’Elbœuf! Deplorable cousin of her Majesty.
The Lord John! Tush—my own unhappy brother!
One must go deeply, make free with the knife, to cut out
of our commonwealth the knot of so much disease.</p>

<p>‘My Lord of Arran,’ he concluded solemnly, ‘your
offence is deep, but the Queen’s deeper than you suppose.
I cannot stay your resentment against the Earl of Bothwell;
it is in the course of nature and of man that you should
be moved. But the Earl of Huntly is the more dangerous
person.’</p>

<p>My Lord James it was who led the now sobbing Arran
to his lodging, and sought his own afterwards, well content
with the night’s work. It is not always that you find two
of your enemies united in wrong-doing, and the service of
the state the service of private grudges.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>When the archers had cleared the streets of the quick,
afterwards came down silently the women and carried
off the hurt and the dead. The women’s office, this, in
Edinburgh.</p>

<p class="tb">The Queen was yet in her bed when Huntly came
swelling into Holyroodhouse, demanding audience as his
right. But the Lord James had been beforehand with
him, and was in the bedchamber with the Secretary, able to
stay, with a look, the usher at the door. ‘It is proper
that your Majesty should be informed of certain grave
occurrents,’ he began to explain; and told her the story
of the night so far as was convenient. According to him,
the Earl of Bothwell mixed the brew and the Earl of
Huntly stirred it. D’Elbœuf was not named, John Stuart
not named—when the Queen asked, what was the broil
about? Ah, her Majesty must hold him excused: it was
an unsavoury tale for a lady’s ear. ‘I should need to be a
deaf lady in order to have comfortable ears, upon your
showing,’ she said sharply. How well he had the secret of
egging her on! ‘Rehearse the tale from the beginning,
my lord; and consider my ears as hardened as your own.’
He let her drag it out of him by degrees: Arran’s mistress,
Bothwell’s night work, so hard following upon night talk
with her; Huntly’s furious pride: rough music indeed for
young ears. But she had no time to shrink from the
sound or to nurse any wound to her own pride. At the
mere mention of Bothwell’s name Mary Livingstone was
up in a red fury, and drove her mistress to her wiles.</p>

<p>‘And this is the brave gentleman,’ cried the maid, ‘this
is the gallant who holds my Queen in his arms, and goes
warm from them to a trollop’s of the town! Fit and right
for the courtier who blasphemes with grooms in the court—but
for you, madam, for you! Well—I hope you will
know your friends in time.’</p>

<p>The Queen looked innocently at her, with the pure
inquiry of a child. ‘What did he want with the girl?
Some folly to gall my Lord Arran, belike.’ Incredible
questions to Livingstone!</p>

<p>Just then they could hear old Lord Huntly storming in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
the antechamber. ‘There hurtles the true offender, in my
judgment,’ said the Lord James.</p>

<p>‘He uses an unmannerly way of excuse,’ says the
Queen, listening to his rhetoric.</p>

<p>‘Madam,’ said Mr. Secretary here, ‘I think he rather
accuses. For his sort are so, that they regard every wrong
they do as a wrong done to themselves. And so, perchance,
it is to be regarded in the ethic part of philosophy.’</p>

<p>‘Why does he rail at my pages? Why does he not
come in?’ the Queen asked. Whereupon the Lord
James nodded to the usher at the door.</p>

<p>Delay had been troublesome to the furious old man,
fretting his nerves and exhausting his indignation before
the time. He was out of breath as well as patience; so
the Queen had the first word, which he had by no means
intended. She held up her finger at him.</p>

<p>‘Ah, my Lord of Huntly, you angered me the other
day, and I overlooked it for the love I bear to your family.
And now, when you have angered me again, you storm in
my house as if it was your own. What am I to think?’</p>

<p>He looked at her with stormy, wet eyes, and spoke
brokenly, being full of his injuries. ‘I am hurt, madam, I
am sore affronted, traduced, stabbed in the back. My son,
madam——!’</p>

<p>She showed anger. ‘Your son! Your son! You have
presumed too far. You offer me marriage with your son,
and he leaves me for a fray in the street!’</p>

<p>Startled, he puffed out his cheeks. ‘I take God to
witness, liars have been behind me. Madam, my son
Gordon had no hand in the night’s work. He was not in
my house; he was not with me; I know not where he was.
A fine young man of his years, look you, madam, may not
be penned up like a sucking calf. No, no. But gallant
sons of mine there were—who have suffered—whose
injuries cry aloud for redress. And, madam, I am here to
claim it at your hands.’</p>

<p>‘Speak your desires of me: I shall listen,’ said she.</p>

<p>The old man looked fixedly at his enemy across the bed.
‘Ay, madam, and so I will.’ He folded his arms, and the
action, and the weight of his wrongs, stemmed his vehemence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
for a while. Dignity also he gained by his restraint, a
quality of which he stood in need; and truly he was
dignified. To hear his account, loyalty to the throne and
to his friends was all the source of his troubles. He had
come down with proffers of alliance to the Queen, and they
laughed him to scorn. He with his two sons rose out of
their beds to quell a riot, to succour their friends——</p>

<p>‘And whom do you call your friends?’ cried the Queen,
interrupting him quickly.</p>

<p>He told her the Hamiltons—but there certainly he lied—good
friends of his and hopeful to be better. The Queen
calmed herself. ‘I had understood that you went to the
rescue of my Lord Bothwell,’ she began; and true it was,
he had. But now he laughed at the thought, and maybe
found it laughable.</p>

<p>‘No, no, madam,’ he said: ‘there are no dealings
betwixt me and the border-thieves. But the Duke hath
made a treaty with me; and it was to help my Lord Arran,
his son, that I and mine went out.’ Well! he had stayed
the riot, he had carved out peace at the sword’s edge.
‘Anon’—and he pointed out the man—‘Anon comes that
creeper by darksome ways, and rewards my sons with
prison-bars—he, that has sought my fair earldom and all!
Ay, madam, ay!’—his voice rose—‘so it is. Of all the
souls in peril last night, some for villainy’s sake, some to
serve their wicked lusts, some for love of the game, and some
for honesty and truth—these last are rewarded by the jail.
Madam, madam, I tell your Majesty, honest men are not to
be bought and sold. You may stretch heart-strings till they
crack; you may tempt the North, and rue the spoiling of
the North. I know whose work this is, what black infernal
stain of blood is in turmoil here. I know, madam, I say,
and you know not. Some are begotten by night, and some
in stealth by day—when the great world is at its affairs, and
the house left empty, and nought rife in it but wicked
humours. Beware this kind, madam—beware it. What
they have lost by the bed they may retrieve by the head.
Unlawful, unlawful—a black strain.’</p>

<p>The Lord James was stung out of himself. ‘By heaven,
madam, this should be stopped!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>The Queen put up her hand. ‘Enough said. My Lord
Huntly, what is your pleasure of me?’</p>

<p>Old Huntly folded up his wrath in his arms once more.
‘I ask, madam, the release of my two sons—of my son
Findlater, and of Adam, my young son, wounded in your
service, sorely wounded, and in bonds.’</p>

<p>‘You frame your petition unhappily,’ said the Queen with
spirit. ‘This is not the way for subjects to handle the
prince.’</p>

<p>He extended his arms, and gaped about him. ‘Subjects,
she saith! Handling, she saith! Oh, now, look you,
madam, how they handle your subject and my boy. He
hath fifteen years to his head, madam, and a chin as smooth
as your own. I fear he is hurt to the death—I fear it sadly;
and it turns me sick to face his mother with the news.
Three sons take I out, and all the hopes I have nursed since
your Majesty lay a babe in your mother’s arm. With one
only I must return, with one only—and no hopes, no hopes
at a’—madam, an old and broken man.’ He was greatly
moved; tears pricked his eyelids and made him fretful.
‘Folly, folly of an old fool! To greet before a bairn!’
He brought tears into the Queen’s eyes.</p>

<p>‘I am sorry for your son Adam,’ she said gently; ‘but
do not you grieve for him. He is too young to suffer for
what he did under duress. You shall not weep before me.
I hate it. It makes me weep with you, and that is forbidden
to queens, they say.’</p>

<p>A man had appeared at the curtain of the door, and
stood hidden in it. The Lord James went to him while the
Queen was turned to the Secretary.</p>

<p>‘Mr. Secretary,’ said she, ‘you shall send up presently to
the Castle. I desire to know how doth Sir Adam of Gordon.
Bring me word as soon as may be.’ She had returned
kindly to the old Earl when her brother was back by
the bed.</p>

<p>‘Madam,’ he said to her, but looked directly at his foe,
‘the injuries of my Lord Huntly’s family are not ended, it
appears. They bring me news——’</p>

<p>That was a slip; the Queen’s cheeks burned. ‘Ah, they
bring <i>you</i> news, my lord!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>He hastened to add: ‘And I, as my duty is, report to
your Majesty, that Sir John Gordon of Findlater hath,
within this hour, broken ward. He is away, madam, leaving
an honest man dead in his room.’ He had made a false
step in the beginning, but the news redeemed him.</p>

<p>The Queen looked very grave. ‘What have you to say
to this, Lord of Huntly?’</p>

<p>‘I say that he is my very son, madam,’ cried the stout
old chief, ‘and readier with his wits than that encroacher
over there.’</p>

<p>Mr. Secretary Lethington covered a smile; the Queen
did not. But she replied: ‘And I say that he is too ready
with his wits; and to you, my lord, I say that you must
fetch him back. I will not be defied.’</p>

<p>She saw his dogged look, and admired it in him. Well
she knew how to soften him now!</p>

<p>‘There shall be no bargain between you and me,’ she
continued, looking keenly at him; ‘but as I have passed
my word, now pass you yours. I will take care of the boy.
He shall be here, and I will teach him to love his Queen
better than his father can do it, I believe. That is my
part. Now for yours: go you out and bring me back Sir
John.’</p>

<p>Old Huntly ran forward to the bed, fell on his knees
beside it, and took the girl’s hand. The tears he now felt
were kindlier, and he let them come. ‘Oh, if you and I
could deal, my Queen,’ he said, ‘all Scotland should go
laughing. If we could deal, as now we have, with the
hearts’ doors open, and none between! Why, I see the
brave days yet! I shall bring back Findlater, fear not for
it; and there shall be Gordons about you like a green
forest—and yourself the bonny, bonny rose bowered in
the midst! God give your Majesty comfort, who have
given back comfort and pride unto me!’</p>

<p>The Queen’s eyes shone with wet as she laughed her
pleasure. ‘Go then, my lord; deal fairly by me.’</p>

<p>He left her there and then, swelling with pride, emotion,
and vanity inflamed, meaning to do well if any man ever
did. He brushed aside Lethington with a sweep of the
arm—‘Clear a way there—clear a way!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>In this Gordon conflict the iniquities of Lord Bothwell
were forgotten, for the Queen’s mind was now set upon
kind offices. She took young Adam into her house and
visited him every day. As you might have expected,
where the lad was handsome and the lady predisposed to
be generous, she looked more than she said, and said more
than she need. Young Adam fell in love with this glimmering,
murmuring, golden princess. Fell, do I say? He
slipped, rather, as in summer one lets oneself slip into the
warm still water. Even so slipped he, and was over the
ears before he was aware. Whatever she may have said,
he made mighty little reply: the Gordons were always
modest before women, and this one but a boy. He hardly
dared look at her when she came, though for a matter of
three hours before he had never taken his eyes from the
door through which she was to glide in upon him like a
Queen of Fays. And the fragrance she carried about her,
the wonder of her which filled the little chamber where he
lay, the sense of a goddess unveiling, of daily miracle, of
her stooping (glorious condescension!), and of his lifting-up—ah,
let him who has deified a lady tell the glory if he
dare! The work was done: she was amused, the miracle
wrought. She had found him a sulky boy, she left him a
budded knight. Here was one of the conquests she made
every day without the drawing of a sword. Most women
loved her, and all boys and girls. But although these are,
after all, the pick of the world—to whom she was the Rose
of roses—we must consider, unhappily, the refuse. They
were the flies at the Honeypot.</p>

<p>Mary Livingstone, not seriously, chid her mistress. ‘Oh,
fie! oh, fie!’ she would say. ‘Do you waste your sweet
store on a bairn? They call you too fond already. Do
you wish to have none but fools about you?’</p>

<p>‘If it is foolish to love me, child,’ said the Queen, pretending
to pout, ‘you condemn yourself. And if it is foolish
of me to love you, or to love Love—again you condemn
yourself, who teach me day by day. Are you jealous
of the little Gordon, or of the little Jean-Marie? Or is it
Monsieur de Châtelard whom you fear?’</p>

<p>‘Châtelard, forsooth! A parrokeet!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>The Queen laughed. ‘If you are jealous, Mary Livingstone,
you must cut off my hands and seal my mouth; for
should you take away all my lovers, I should stroke the
pillars of the house till they were warm, and kiss the maids
in the kitchen until they were clean. I must love, my dear,
and be loved: that I devoutly believe.’</p>

<p>‘Lord Jesus, and so do I!’ groaned the good girl, and
thanked Him on whom she called that Bothwell’s day was
over. For although she said not a word of the late scandal,
she watched every day and lay awake o’ nights for any
sign that he was in the Queen’s thoughts. All she could
discover for certain was that he came no more to Court.
And yet he was in or near Edinburgh. The old Duke of
Châtelherault had himself announced one day in a great
taking, with a pitiful story of his son Arran. Lord Bothwell’s
name rang loud in it. His son Arran, cousin (he was
careful to say) of her Majesty’s, being highly incensed at
the affront he had suffered, had challenged the Earl of
Bothwell to a battle of three on a side. The weapons had
been named, the men chosen. My Lord Bothwell had
kept tryst, Arran (on his father’s counsel) had not. Thereupon
my Lord Bothwell cries aloud, in the hearing of a
score persons, ‘We’ll drag him out by the lugs, gentlemen!’
and set about to do it. ‘My son Arran, madam,
goes in deadly fear; for so ruthless a man, a man so
arrogant upon the laws as this Lord of Bothwell vexeth not
your Majesty’s once prosperous realm. Alas, that such
things should be! Madam, I gravely doubt for my son’s
safety.’</p>

<p>‘Why, what would you have of me, cousin?’ says the
Queen. ‘I cannot fight your son’s battle. Courage I
cannot give him. Am I to protect him in my house?’</p>

<p>‘It is protection, indeed, madam, that I crave. But
your Majesty knows very well in what guise I would have
him enter your house.’</p>

<p>This was too open dealing to be dextrous in such a
delicate market.</p>

<p>‘Upon my word, cousin,’ says the Queen, ‘I think that
you carry your plans of protection too far if you propose
that I should shelter him in my bed.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>The old Duke looked so confounded at this blunt
commentary that she repented later, and promised that she
would try a reconciliation. ‘But I cannot move in it
myself,’ she told him. ‘There are many reasons against
that. Do you say that my Lord Bothwell threatens the
life of your son?’</p>

<p>‘Indeed, madam, I do fear it.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I will see that he does not get it. Leave me to
deal as I can.’</p>

<p>The Queen sent for Mr. Knox.</p>

<h3 id="I_CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="smaller">HERE ARE FLIES AT THE HONEYPOT</span></h3>

<p>‘The Comic Mask now appears,’ says <i>Le Secret des Secrets</i>
in a reflective mood, ‘the Comic Mask, with a deprecatory
grin, to show how it was the misfortune of Scotland at this
time that, being a poor country, every funded man in it
was forced to fatten his glebe at the cost of his neighbour’s.
So house was set against house, friendship made a vain
thing, and loyalty a marketable thing. More than that,
every standard of value set up to be a beacon or channel-post
or point of rally (whichever you chose to make it),
became <i>ipso facto</i> a tower of vantage, from which, if you
were to draw your dues, it was necessary to scare everybody
else. When Mr. Knox sourly called Queen Mary a
Honeypot, he intended to hold her out to scorn; but
actually he decried his countrymen who saw her so; and
not saw her only, but every high estate beside. For them
the Church was a honeypot, the council, the command of
the shore, the wardenry of the marches. “Come,” they
said, “let us eat and drink of this store, but for God’s sake
keep off the rest, or it will never hold out.” Round about,
round about, came the buzzing flies, at once eager and
querulous; and while they sipped they looked from the
corners of their eyes lest some other should get more than
his share; and the murmurs of the feasters were as often
“Give him less” as “Give me more.” Yet it would be
wrong, I conceive, to call the Scots lords all greedy; safer
to remember that most of them must certainly have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
hungry.’ So Monsieur Des-Essars obtrudes his chorus—after
the event.</p>

<p>Young Queen Mary, hard-up against the event, had no
chorus but trusty Livingstone of the red cheeks and warm
heart; nor until her first Christmas was kept and gone was
she conscious of needing one. She had maintained a high
spirit through all the dark and windy autumn days, finding
Bothwell’s effrontery as easy to explain as the Duke’s
poltroonery, or the hasty veering of old Huntly. Bothwell,
she would extenuate, held her cheap because women were
his pastime, the Duke sought her protection because he
was a coward, Huntly shied off because his vanity was
offended. If men indeed had ever been so simple to be
explained, this world were as easy to manage as a pasteboard
theatre. The simplicity was her own; but she
shared the quality with another when she sent for Mr.
Knox because she thought him her rival, and when he
came prepared to play the part.</p>

<p>The time was November, with the floods out and rain
that never ceased. It was dark all day outside the palace;
raw cold and showers of sleet mastered the town; but
within, great fires made the chambers snug where the
Queen sat with her maids and young men. The French
lords had taken their leave, the pageants and dancings
were stayed for a time. In a diminished Court, which held
neither the superb Princes of Guise nor the hardy-tongued
Lord of Bothwell—in a domesticated, needleworking,
chattering, hearth-haunting Court—there was a great
adventure for the coy excellences of Monsieur de Châtelard.
Discussing his prospects freely with Des-Essars, he told
him that he had two serious rivals only. ‘Monsieur de
Boduel,’ he said, ‘forces my Princess to think of him by
insulting her. He appears to succeed; but so would the
man who should twist your arm, my little Jean-Marie, and
make cuts with the hand at the fleshy part. He would
compel you to think of him, but with fear. Now, fear,
look you, is not the lady’s part in love, but the man’s, the
perfect lover’s part. For it may be doubted whether a
woman can ever be a perfect lover—if only for this reason,
that she is designed for the love of a man. The Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Gordon, eldest son and heir of that savage greybeard,
Monsieur de Huntly, is my other adversary in the sweet
warfare. She looks at him as you must needs observe a
church tower in your Brabant. It is the tallest thing there;
you cannot avoid it. But what fine long legs can prevail
against the silken tongue? Not his, at least. Therefore I
sing my best, I dance, I stand prayerful at corners of the
corridor. And one day, when I see her pensive, or hear
her sigh as she goes past me, do you know what I shall
do? I shall run forward and clasp her knees, and cry
aloud, “We bleed, we bleed, Princess, we bleed! Come,
my divine balm, let us stanch mutually these wounds of
ours. For I too have balsam for thee!” Do you not
think the plan admirable?’</p>

<p>‘It is very poetical,’ said Des-Essars, ‘and has this
merit, usually denied to poetry, that it is uncommonly
explicit. I think I know better than you what are the
designs of Monsieur de Boduel, since he was once my
master. He does not seek to insult or to terrify my
mistress, as you seem to suppose—but to induce her to
trust him. He would wish to appear to her in the character
of the one man in Scotland who does not seek some
advantage from her. My Lord Gordon’s designs—to use
the word for convenience, though, in fact, he has no
designs—are as simple as yours. He is infatuated; the
Queen has turned his head; and it is no wonder, seeing
that she troubled herself to do it.’</p>

<p>‘If he has no designs, boy,’ cried Monsieur de Châtelard,
‘how can you compare him with me, who have
many?’</p>

<p>Des-Essars clasped his hands behind his head. ‘I
suppose you are the same in this, at least,’ he said, ‘that
both of you seek to get pleasure out of my mistress. Let
me tell you that your most serious rival of all is one of
whom you know nothing—one who seeks neither pleasure
nor profit from her; to whom, therefore, she will almost
certainly offer the utmost of her store.’</p>

<p>‘Who is this remarkable man, pray?’</p>

<p>‘It is Master Knox, the Genevan preacher,’ said Des-Essars.
‘I think there is more danger to the Queen’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
heart in this man’s keeping than in that of the whole Privy
Council of this kingdom.’</p>

<p>Monsieur de Châtelard was profoundly surprised. ‘I
had never considered him at all,’ he admitted. ‘In my
country, Jean-Marie, and I suppose in yours also, we do
not consider the gentry of religion until our case is become
extreme. Of what kindred is this man?’</p>

<p>‘He is of the sons of Adam, I suppose, and a tall one.
I have seen him.’</p>

<p>‘You mistake me, my boy. Hath he blood, for
example?’</p>

<p>‘Sir, I will warrant it very red. In fine, sir, this man is
King of Scotland; and, though it may surprise you to
hear me say so, I will be so bold as to add in your private
ear, that no true lover of the Queen my mistress could
wish her to give up her heart into any other keeping
which this country can furnish.’</p>

<p>Monsieur de Châtelard, after a short, quick turn about
the room, came back to Des-Essars vivacious and angry.
‘You speak absurdly, like the pert valet you are likely to
become. What can you know of love—you, who dare to
dispose of your mistress’s heart in this fashion?’</p>

<p>Des-Essars looked grave. ‘It is open to me, young as
I am, to love the Queen my mistress, and to desire her
welfare. I love her devotedly; but I swear that I desire
nothing else. Nor does my partner and sworn ally,
Monsieur Adam de Gordon.’</p>

<p>‘Love,’ said Monsieur de Châtelard, tapping his bosom,
‘severs brotherhoods and dissolves every oath. It is a
perfectly selfish passion: even the beloved must suffer for
the lover’s need. Do you and your partner suppose that
you can stay my advance? The thought is laughable.’</p>

<p>‘We neither suppose it nor propose it,’ replied the youth.
‘We are considering the case of Mr. Knox, and are agreed
that, detestable as his opinions may be, there is great force
in them because of the great force in himself. We think
he may draw the Queen’s favour by the very neglect he
hath of it; and although our natures would lead us to
advance the suit of my Lord Gordon, who is my colleague’s
blood-brother, as you know—for all that, it is our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
deliberate intention to throw no obstacle in the way of any
pretensions this Master Knox may chance to exhibit.’</p>

<p>‘And, pray,’ cried Monsieur de Châtelard, drawing
himself up, ‘and, pray, how do you look upon my pretensions,
which, I need not tell you, do not embrace
marriage?’</p>

<p>‘To tell you the truth, sir,’ Des-Essars replied, ‘we do
not look upon them at all.’</p>

<p>Monsieur de Châtelard was satisfied. ‘I think you are
very wise,’ he said. ‘No eye should look upon the deed
which I meditate. Fare you well, Jean-Marie. I speak as
a man forewarned.’</p>

<p>Jean-Marie returned to his problems.</p>

<p>Standing at the Queen’s door, he had his plan cut and
dried. When the preacher should be brought in by the
usher, he would require a word with him before he pulled
back the curtain. He does not confess to it in his
memoirs; but I have no doubt what that word was to
have been. Remember that there was this much sound
sense on the boy’s side: he knew very well that the Queen
had thought more of Mr. Knox than she had cared to
allow. His inferences may have been ridiculous; it is one
thing to read into the hearts of kings, another to dispose
them. However that may be, the Captain of the Guard
had received his orders. He himself introduced the great
man into the antechamber, and led him directly to the
entry of the Queen’s closet. Mr. Erskine, who held this
office, was also Master of the Pages, and no mere gentleman-usher.
He brushed aside his subaltern with no more
ceremony than consists in a flack of the ear, and, ‘Back,
thou French pullet—the Queen’s command.’ Immediately
afterwards he announced at the door, ‘Madam, Mr. Knox,
to serve your Majesty.’</p>

<p>‘Enter boldly, Mr. Knox,’ he bade his convoy then, and
departed, leaving him in the doorway face to face with the
Queen of Scots.</p>

<p>She sat in a low chair, tapestry on her knees, her needle
flying fast; in her white mourning, as always when she
had her own way, she looked a sweet and wholesome
young woman. Mary Livingstone, self-possessed and busy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
was on a higher chair behind her, watching the work;
Mary Fleming in the bay of the window, Lord Lindsay
near by her, leaning against the wall. Mary Beaton and
Mary Seton were on cushions on the floor, each holding an
end of the long frame. Mr. Secretary regardful by the
door, and a lady who sat at a little table reading out of
<i>Perceforest</i> or <i>Amadis</i>, or some such, completed as quiet
an interior as you could wish to see. While Mr. Knox
stood primed for his duty, scrutinised by half a dozen pair
of eyes, the Queen alone did not lift hers up, but picked
at a knot with her needle.</p>

<p>The tangle out, ‘Let Mr. Knox take heart,’ she said,
with the needle’s eye to the light and the wool made sharp
by her tongue: ‘here he shall find a few busy girls putting
to shame some idle men.’ Seeing that Mr. Knox made no
sign—as how should he, who needed not take what he had
never lost?—she presently turned her head and looked
cheerfully at him, her first sight of a redoubtable critic.
Singly her thoughts came, one on the heels of the other:
her first, This man is very tall; the second, He looks
kind; the third, He loves a jest; the fourth, which stayed
long by her, The deep wise eyes he hath! In a long head
of great bones and little flesh those far-set, far-seeing, large,
considering eyes shone like lamps in the daylight—full of
power at command, kept in control, content to wait. They
told her nothing, yet she saw that they had a store behind.
No doubt but the flame was there. If the day made it
mild, in the dark it would beacon men. She saw that he
had a strong nose, like a raven’s beak, a fleshy mouth,
the beard of a prophet, the shoulders and height of a
mountaineer. In one large hand he held his black bonnet,
the other was across his breast, hidden in the folds of his
cloak. There was no man present of his height, save
Lethington, and he looked a weed. There was no man
(within her knowledge) of his patience, save the Lord
James; and she knew him at heart a coward. Peering
through her narrowed eyes for those few seconds, she had
the fancy that this Knox was like a ragged granite cross,
full of runes, wounded, weather-fretted, twisted awry. Yet
her four thoughts persisted: He is very tall, he looks kind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
he loves a jest—and oh! the deep wise eyes he hath!
Nothing that he did or spoke against her afterwards
moved the roots of those opinions. She may have feared,
but she never shrank from the man.</p>

<p>Now she took up her words where she had left them.
‘You, who love not idleness, Mr. Knox, are here to help
me, I hope?’</p>

<p>He blinked before he answered. ‘Madam,’ then said
he, ‘I am here upon your summons, since subjects are
bound to obey, that I may know your pleasure of me.’
‘A sweet, dangerous woman,’ he thought her still; but he
added now, ‘And of all these dainty ladies the daintiest,
and the shrewdest reader of men.’</p>

<p>‘Come then, Mr. Knox, and be idle or busy as likes
you best,’ she said, and resumed her needle. ‘I am glad
to know,’ she added, ‘that you consider yourself bound
anyways to me.’</p>

<p>He, not moving from his doorway—making it serve
him rather for a pulpit—when he had thought for awhile,
with quickly blinking eyes, began: ‘I think that you seek
to put me to some question, madam, but without naming
it. I think that you would have me justify myself without
cause cited. But this I shall not do, lest afterwards come
in your Clerk of Arraigns and I find myself prejudged
upon my plea before I am accused at all. Why, in this
matter of service of subjects, we are all in a manner bound
upon it. Many masters must we obey: as God and His
stewards, who are girded angels; and Death and his
officers, who are famines, diseases, fires, and the swords
of violent men, suffered by God for primordial reasons;
and next the prince and his ministers, among whom I
reckon——’</p>

<p>‘Oh, sir; oh, sir,’ she cried out, ‘you go too fast for me!’</p>

<p>‘Madam,’ said he, ‘I speak with respect, but I do think
you go as fast as I.’</p>

<p>She laughed. ‘I am young, Mr. Knox, and go as fast
as I can. Do you blame me for that?’</p>

<p>‘I may not, madam,’ said he steadily, ‘unless to
remember that you sit in an old seat be to blame you.’</p>

<p>‘I sit at my needlework now, sir.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>He saw her fine head bent over the web, a gesture
beautifully meek, but said he: ‘I suspect the seat is
beneath your Majesty. It is hard to win, yet harder to
leave when the time comes.’</p>

<p>‘But,’ said she, ‘if I put aside my seat, if I waive my
authority, how would you consider me then?’</p>

<p>He turned his head from one to another, and then
gazed calmly at the Queen. ‘Madam,’ he said, ‘if you
waive your authority and put aside your seat, the which
(you say) you have from God, why then should I consider
you at all?’</p>

<p>When the room stirred, she laughed, but it was to
conceal her vexation. She pricked her lip with her
needle.</p>

<p>‘I see how it is with you and your friends, sir,’ she said
drily. ‘You love not poor women in any wise. When we
are upon thrones you call us monsters, and when we come
off them you think us nothing at all. It is hard to please
you. And yet—you have known women.’</p>

<p>‘A many,’ said he.</p>

<p>‘And of these some were good women?’</p>

<p>‘There was one, madam, the best of women.’</p>

<p>Her eyes sparkled. ‘Ah! You speak kindly at last!
You loved my mother! Then you will love me. Is it
not so?’</p>

<p>He was silent. This was perilous work.</p>

<p>‘I have sent for you, Mr. Knox,’ she continued, ‘not for
dialectic, in which I can see I am no match for you; but
to ask counsel of you, and require a benevolence, if you are
ready to bestow it. We will talk alone of these things,
if you will. Adieu, mes enfants; gentlemen, adieu. I
must speak privately with Mr. Knox.’</p>

<p>What had she to say to him? Not he alone wondered;
there was Master Des-Essars at the door—Master Des-Essars,
who, with the generosity of calf-love, was prepared
to surrender his rights for the good of the State. Mary
Livingstone, to whom one man, lover of the Queen, was
as pitiable as another, swept through the anteroom
without a word for anybody. The others clustered in
the bay, whispering and wondering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>But as to Mr. Knox, when those two were alone, she
baffled him altogether by asking him to intervene in the
quarrel between the Lords Bothwell and Arran: baffled
him, that is, because he had braced himself for tears,
reproaches, and what he called ‘yowling’ against his
‘Stinking Pride’ sermon, which of late had made some stir.
In that matter he was ready to take his stand upon the
holy hill of Sion; he had his countermines laid against her
mines. Yea, if she had cried out upon the book of the
<i>Monstrous Regiment</i> itself, he had his pithy retorts, his
citations from Scripture, his Aristotle, his Saint Paul, and
Aquinas—for he did not disdain that serviceable papist—his
heavy cavalry from Geneva and his light horsemen from
Ayrshire greens. But she took no notice of this entrenched
position of his: she drew him into open country, then
swept out and caught him in the flank. Choosing to
assume, against all evidence, that he had loved her mother,
assuming that he loved her too, she pleaded with him to
serve her well, and used the subtlest flattery of all, which
was to take for granted that he would refuse what she
begged. This was an incense so heady that the flinty-edged
brain was drugged by it, declined ratiocination. As
she pleaded, in low urgent tones, which cried sometimes as
if she was hurt, and thrilled sometimes as though she
exulted in her pure desire, he listened, sitting motionless
above her, more moved than he cared afterwards to own.
‘For peace’s sake I came hither, young as I am, and
because I desire to dwell among my own folk. I hoped
for peace, and do think that I ensued it. Have I vexed
any of you in anything? Have I oppressed any?’ At
such a time, against such pleading, he had it not in his
heart to cry out, ‘Ay, daily, hourly, you vex, thwart,
and offend the Lord’s people.’</p>

<p>Seeing him silent, pondering above her, she stretched
out her arms for a minute, and bewitched him utterly with
her slow, sad smile. ‘If a girl of my years can be tyrant
over grave councillors, if that be possible, and I have done
it, I shall not be too stiff to ask pardon for my fault, or to
come to you and your friends, Mr. Knox, to learn a wiser
way. But you cannot accuse me. I see you answer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
nothing.’ Whether he could or not, he did not at that
time.</p>

<p>She came back to her first proposition. ‘Of my Lord
of Bothwell I know only this,’—she seemed to weigh her
words,—‘that in France he approved himself the very
honest gentleman whom I looked to find him here. He is
not of my faith; he favours England more than I am as
yet prepared to do; he is stern upon the border. What
his quarrel may be with my Lord of Arran I do not care
to inquire. I pray it may be soon ended, for the peace’s
sake which I promised myself. Why should I be unhappy?
You cannot wish it.’</p>

<p>‘Madam,’ he said, in his deep slow voice, ‘God knoweth
I do not.’</p>

<p>She looked down; she whispered, ‘You are kind to me.
You will help me?’</p>

<p>‘Madam,’ he said, ‘God being with me, I will.’ She
looked up at him like a child, held out her hand. He took
it in his own; and there it lay for a while contented.</p>

<p>Upon this fluttering moment the Lord James, walking
familiarly in king’s houses, entered with a grave inclination
of the head. The Queen was vexed, but she was ready,
and resumed her hand. Mr. Knox was not ready. He
stiffened himself, and opened his mouth to speak: no words
came. The Lord James went solemnly to his side and put
a hand on his shoulder. The Queen’s eyes flashed.</p>

<p>‘Madam,’ he said, ‘I am glad that my friend Mr. Knox
should be here.’</p>

<p>‘Upon my word, my lord,’ cried the Queen in a rage,
‘why should you be glad, or what has your gladness to do
with the matter?’ Mr. Knox, before she spoke, had gently
disengaged himself; now he made her a deep obeisance and
took his leave—not walking backwards. ‘That is a true
man,’ was her judgment of him, and never substantially
altered. What he may have thought of her, if he afterwards
discovered how she had used him here, is another
question. He set about doing her behests, at any rate.
There was a probability that my Lord Bothwell would show
himself at Court again before many days, and without
direct invitation of hers.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="I_CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="smaller">THE FOOL’S WHIP</span></h3>

<p>After a progress about the kingdom, which she thought
it well to make for many reasons—room for the pacifying
arm of Mr. Knox being one—it befell as she had hoped.
Speedily and well had the preacher gone to work: the Earl
of Arran walked abroad without a bodyguard, the Earl of
Bothwell showed himself at Court and was received upon
his former footing. The Queen had looked sharply at him,
on his first appearance, for any sign of a shameful face;
there was not to be seen the shadow of a shade. It is not
too much to say that she would have been greatly disappointed
if there had been any; for to take away hardihood
from this man would be to make his raillery a ridiculous
offence, his gay humour a mere symptom of the tavern.
No, but he laughed at her as slyly as ever before; he
reassumed his old pretensions, he gave back no inch of
ground—and, remember, in an affair of the sort, if the man
holds his place the maid must yield something of hers. It
is bound to be a case of give or take. She felt herself in
the act to give, was glad of it, and concealed it from Mary
Livingstone. When this girl, her bosom friend and bedfellow,
made the outcry you might expect of her, the
Queen pretended extreme surprise.</p>

<p>‘Do you suppose this country the Garden of Eden, my
dear? Are all the Scots lords wise virgins, careful over
lamp-wicks? Am I Queen of a Court of Love by chance,
and is my Lord of Bothwell a postulant? You tell me
news. I assure you he is nothing to me.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Now these words were spoken on a day when he had
declared himself something as plainly as was convenient.
Exactly what had happened was this:—</p>

<p>On the anniversary-day of the death of little King
Francis of France, the Queen kept the house with her
maids, and professed to see nobody. A requiem had been
sung, the faithful few attending in black mourning. She,
upon a faldstool, solitary before the altar at the pall, looked
a very emblem of pure sorrow—exquisitely dressed in long
nun-like weeds; no relief of white; her face very pale,
hands thin and fragile, only one ring to the whole eight
fingers. Motionless, not observed to open her lips, wink
her eyes, scarcely seen to breathe, there she stayed when
mass was done and the chapel empty, save for women and
a page or two.</p>

<p>At noon, just before dinner, she walked in the garden,
kept empty by her directions—a few turns with Beaton
and Fleming, and Des-Essars for escort—then, bidding
them leave her, sat alone in a yew-tree bower in full sun.
It was warm dry weather for the season.</p>

<p>Presently, as she sat pensive, toying perhaps with grief,
trying to recall it or maintain it—who knows?—she heard
footsteps not far off, voices in debate; and looked sidelong
up to see who could be coming. It was the Earl of
Bothwell who showed himself first round the angle of
the terrace, arm-in-arm of that Lord Arran whom she
had procured to be his friend; behind these two were
Ormiston, some Hamilton or another, and Paris, Lord
Bothwell’s valet. They were in high spirits and free talk,
those two lords, unconscious or careless of her privacy;
Bothwell was gesticulating in that French way he had;
the other, with his head inclined, listened closely, and
sniggered in spite of himself. Both were in cheerful
colours; notably, Bothwell wore crimson cloth with a
cloak of the same, a purpoint of lace, a white feather in
his cap. Arran first saw the Queen, stopped instantly,
uncovered, and said something hasty to his companion;
he stared with his light fish-eyes and kept his mouth
open. Bothwell looked up in his good time and bared
his head as he did so. It seems that he muttered some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
order or advice, for when Lord Arran slipped by on the
tips of his toes, all the rest followed him; but Lord
Bothwell walked leisurely over the grass towards the
Queen, as who should say, ‘I am in the wrong—in truth
I am a careless devil. Well, give me my due; admit I
am not a timorous devil.’</p>

<p>As he stood before her, attentive and respectful in his
easy way, she watched him nearly, and he waited for her
words. It is a sign of how they stood to one another at
this time that she began her speech in the middle—as if
her thoughts, in spite of herself, became at a point
articulate.</p>

<p>‘You also, my lord!’</p>

<p>‘<i>Plaît-il?</i>’</p>

<p>‘Oh, you understand me very well.’</p>

<p>‘Madam, upon my honour! I am a dull dog that can
see but one thing at a time.’</p>

<p>She forced herself to speak. ‘I ask you, then, if this
is the day of all days when you choose to pass by me in
your festival gear? I ask if you also are with the rest
of them?’</p>

<p>He made as if he would spread his hands out—the
motion was enough. It said—though he was silent—‘Madam,
I am no better than other men.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I believe it, I believe it! You are no better
indeed; but I had thought you wiser.’</p>

<p>He caught at the word, and rubbed his chin over it.
‘Hey, my faith, madam—wiser!’</p>

<p>The Queen tapped her foot. ‘If I had said kinder, I
might have betrayed myself for a fool. Kindness, wisdom,
generosity, pity! In all these things I must believe you
to be as other men. Is it not so?’</p>

<p>Seeing her clouded eyes, he did not affect to laugh any
more. He was either a bad courtier or one supremely
expert; for he spoke as irritably as he felt.</p>

<p>‘Madam, I know few men save men of spirit, therefore
I cannot advise you. But you know the saw, <i>Come asino
sape così minuzza rape</i>: “The donkey bites his carrot as
well as he knows.” Wisdom is becoming to a servant;
kindness, generosity, and the rest of these high virtues are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
the ornament of a master, or mistress. Why, madam, if
I desire the warmth of the sun, shall I ever get it by
shivering? Is that a wise reflection?’</p>

<p>She clasped her hands over her knee, and looked at her
foot as she swung it slowly; but if the action was idle the
words were not. ‘If I asked you, my lord, to wear the
dule with me upon this one day of the year, should you
refuse me? If I grieve, will you not grieve with me?’</p>

<p>He never faltered, but spoke as gaily as a sailor to his
lass. ‘Faith of a gentleman, madam, why should I grieve—except
for that you should grieve still? For your
grieving there may be a remedy; and as for me, far from
grieving with you, I thank the kindly gods.’</p>

<p>She bit her lip as she shivered. ‘You are cruel,’ she
said: ‘you are cruel. I knew it before. Your heart is
cruel. This is the very subtlety of the vice.’</p>

<p>‘Not so, madam,’ he answered quietly; ‘but it is
dangerous simplicity. Do you not know why I give
thanks?—I think you do, indeed.’</p>

<p>Very certainly she thought so too.</p>

<p>She sat on after he was gone, twisting her fingers about
as she spun her busy fancies; and was so found by her
maids. Little King Francis and the purple pall which
signified him were buried for that day; and after dinner
she changed her black gown for a white. It was at going
to bed that night that she had rallied Mary Livingstone
about Scots lords and wise virgins, and declared that Lord
Bothwell was nothing to her. And the maid believed her
just as far as you or I may do.</p>

<p>Not that the thing was grown serious by any means:
the maid of honour made too much of one possible lover,
and the Queen, very likely, too little. The difference
between these two was this: Mary Livingstone looked
upon her Majesty’s lovers with a match-maker’s eye, but
Queen Mary with a shepherding eye. The flock was
everything to her. Just now, for example, she was
anxious about certain other strays; and, as time wore on
to the dark of the year, she began to be impatient. The
Gordons, said her brother James, were playing her false;
but it was incredible to her—not that they should be at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
fault, but that her instinct should be so. She could have
sworn to the truth of that fine Lord Gordon, and been
certain that she had won over old Huntly at the last.
The mistake—if she was mistaken—is common to queens
and pretty children, who, finding themselves in the centre
of their world, give that a circumference beyond the line
of sight. Because all eyes are upon them they think that
there is nothing else to be seen. She was to learn that
Huntly at Court and Huntly in Badenoch were two
separate persons; so said the Lord James.</p>

<p>‘Sister, alas! I fear a treacherous and stiff-necked
generation’; and he had more to go upon than he chose
her to guess as yet.</p>

<p>So far, at least, she had to admit that old Huntly was
a liar: John of Findlater was never brought back. Her
messengers returned again and again, saying, ‘The Earl
was in the hills,’ or ‘The Earl was hunting the deer,’ or
‘The Earl was punishing the Forbeses.’ And where was
her fine Lord Gordon, with his sea-blue, hawk’s eyes?
She was driven at last to send after him—a peremptory
summons to meet her at Dundee; but he never came—could
not be found or served with the letter—was believed
to be with the Earl, his father, but had been heard of in
the west with the Hamiltons, etc. etc. The face of Lord
James—his eyes ever upon the Earldom of Moray—was
sufficient answer to her doubts; and when she turned to
Lord Bothwell for comfort, he laughed and said, reminding
her of a former conversation, ‘Prick the old bladder,
madam, scatter the pease; then watch warily who come to
the feast.’</p>

<p>Then a certain Lord Ruthven entered her field, sent for
out of Gowrie—a dour, pallid man, with fatality pressing
heavily on his forehead. It seemed to weigh his brows
over his eyes, and to goad him at certain stressful times
to outbursts of savagery—snarling, tooth-baring—terrible
to behold. He hated Huntly as one Scots lord could hate
another, for no known reason.</p>

<p>‘You ask me what you shall do with Huntly, madam?
I say, hang him on a tree, and poison crows with him.
It will be the best service he can ever do you.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>He said this at the council board, and dismayed her
sorely. It seemed to her that he churned his spleen
between his teeth till it foamed at his loose lips.</p>

<p>She flew to the comfort of her maids: here was her
cabinet of last resource! They throned her among them,
put their heads near together, and considered the case of
Scotland. Mary Livingstone could see but one remedy
for the one deep-set disease. Bothwell’s broad chest
shadowed all the realm as with a cloud: chase that away,
you might get a glimpse of poor Scotland; but while the
dreadful gloom endured the Gordons seemed to her a
swarm of gnats, harmless at a distance. ‘Let them starve
in their own quags, my dear heart,’ she said; ‘you will
have them humble when they are hungry. Theirs is the
sin of pride—but, O Mother of Heaven, keep us clean
from the sin that laughs at sinning!’</p>

<p>Mary Fleming put in a word for the advice of Mr.
Secretary Lethington, but blushed when the others nudged
each other. The Secretary was known to be her servant.
Mary Beaton said, ‘I thought we were to speak of
Huntly? <i>Ma belle dame</i>, touch his heart with your finger-tips.’</p>

<p>‘So I would if I knew the way,’ said the Queen, frowning.</p>

<p>‘Send him back his bonny boy Adam,’ says Beaton;
‘I undertake that he will plead your cause. You have
given him good reason.’</p>

<p>The Queen thought well of this; so presently Adam
Gordon was sent north as legate <i>a latere</i>.</p>

<p class="tb">Christmas went out, Lent drew on, the months passed.
The Ark of State tossed in unrestful waters, but young
Adam of Gordon came not again with a slip of olive.
‘If that child should prove untrue,’ said the Queen,
‘then his father is the lying traitor you report him.’ This
to Mr. Secretary Lethington, very much with her just now,
at work for Mr. Secretary Cecil of England, trying his
hardest to bring about a meeting between his mistress and
the mistress of his friend. Lethington, knowing what he
did know, had little consolation for her; but he bore word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
to his master, the Lord James, that the Queen was
angering fast with the Gordons; a very little more and
the fire would leap.</p>

<p>‘In my poor judgment,’ he said, ‘the kindling-spark
will be struck when she sees the scribbling of her love-image.
She hath fashioned a very Eros out of George
Gordon.’</p>

<p>‘I conceive, Mr. Secretary,’ said the Lord James,
making no sign that he had heard him, ‘that the times
are ripe for our budget of news.’</p>

<p>‘I think with your lordship,’ the Secretary replied,
‘but will you be your own post-boy?’</p>

<p>‘Ah! I am a dullard, Mr. Secretary,’ said my lord.
‘Your mind forges in front of mine.’</p>

<p>He was fond of penning his agents in close corners.
Let them be explicit since he would never be. Lethington
gulped his chagrin.</p>

<p>‘My meaning was, my lord, that it will advantage you
more to confirm than to spread your news concerning the
Lord Gordon. Whoso tells her Majesty a thing to anger
her, I have observed that he will surely receive some part
of her wrath. Not so the man who is forced to admit the
truth of a report. He, on the contrary, gains trust; for
delicacy in a courtier outweighs integrity with our mistress.
Therefore let the Duke bring the news, and do you wait
until you can bow your head over it. Perhaps I speak
more plainly than I ought.’</p>

<p>‘I think you do, sir, indeed,’ says the Lord James, and
lacerates his Lethington.</p>

<p class="tb">There was a masque upon Shrove Tuesday, the last day
of Carnival, and much folly done, which ended, like a
child’s romp, in a sobbing fit. Amid the lights, music,
laughter of the throng, the Queen and her maids braved it
as saucy young men, trunked, puffed, pointed, trussed and
doubleted; short French cloaks over one shoulder, flat
French caps over one ear. Mary Livingstone was the
properest, being so tall, Mary Fleming the least at ease,
Mary Beaton the pertest, and Mary Seton the prettiest
boy. But Mary the Queen was the most provoking, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
trimmest, most assured little gallant that ever you saw;
and yet, by that art she had, that extraordinary tact, never
more a queen than when now so much a youth. Her
trunks were green and her doublet white velvet; her cloak
was violet threaded with gold. Her cap was as scarlet as
her lips; but there was no jewel in her ear or her girdle to
match her glancing eyes. By a perverse French courtesy,
which became them very ill, such men as dared to do it,
or had chins to show, were habited like women. Queen
Mary led out Monsieur de Châtelard in a ruff and hooped
gown; Des-Essars made a nun of himself, most demure and
most uncomfortable; Mary Fleming chose the Earl of
Arran—the only Scot in the mummery—a shepherdess
with a crook. Mary Livingstone would not dance. ‘Never,
never, never!’ cried she. ‘Let women ape men, as I am
doing: the thing is natural; we would all be men if we
could. But a man in a petticoat, a man that can blush—ah,
bah! <i>pourriture de France!</i>’</p>

<p>That night, rotten or not, Monsieur de Châtelard played
the French game. Queen Mary held him, led him about,
bowed where he curtsied, stood while he sat. He grew
bolder as the din grew wilder; he said he was the Queen’s
wife. She thought him a fool, but owned to a kind of sneaking
tenderness for folly of the sort. He called her his dear
lord, his sweet lord, said he was faint and must lean upon
her arm. He promised to make her jealous—went very
far in his part. He swore that it was all a lie—he loved
his husband only: ‘Kiss me, dear hub, I am sick of love!’
he languished, and she did kiss his cheek. More she
would not; indeed, when she saw the old Duke of Châtelherault
struggling through the crowd about the doors, she
felt that here was a chance of getting out of a tangle. She
flung the sick monkey off and went directly towards the
Duke. He had come to town that day, she knew, directly
from his lands in the west: perhaps he would know something
of the Gordons. He was a frail, pink-cheeked old
man, with a pointed white beard and delicate hands; so
simple as to be nearly a fool, and yet not so nearly but
that he had been able to beget Lord Arran, a real fool.
When he understood that this swaggering young prince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
was indeed his queen, he gave up bowing and waving his
hands, and dropped upon his knee, having very courtly
old ways with him.</p>

<p>‘Dear madam, dear my cousin, the Lothians show the
greener for your abiding. ’Tis shrewish weather yet in
the hills; but you make a summer here.’</p>

<p>‘Rise up, my cousin,’ says the Queen, ‘and come talk
with me.’ She drew him to a settle by the wall. ‘What
news of your house and country have you for me?’</p>

<p>‘I hope I shall content your Majesty,’ he said, rubbing
his fine hands. ‘We of the west have been junketing.
We have killed fatlings for a marriage.’</p>

<p>She was interested, suspecting nothing. ‘Ah, you have
made a marriage! and I was not told! You used me
ill, cousin.’</p>

<p>‘Madam,’ he pleaded somewhat confusedly, ‘it was
done in haste: there were many reasons for that. Take
one—my poor health and hastening years. Nor did time
serve to make Hamilton a house. It was a fortalice,
and must remain a fortalice for my lifetime. But for
your Grace——’ He stopped, seeing that she did not
listen.</p>

<p>She made haste to turn him on again. ‘Whom did
you marry? Not my Lord of Arran, for he is pranking
here. And you design him for me, if I remember.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, madam!’ He was greatly upset by such plain
talk. ‘No, no. It was my daughter Margaret. My
son Arran! Ah, that’s a greater thing. My daughter
Margaret, madam——’</p>

<p>‘Yes, yes. But the man—the man!’</p>

<p>‘Madam, the Lord of Gordon took her.’ He beamed
with pride and contentment. ‘Yes, yes, the Lord of
Gordon—a pact of amity between two houses not always
too happily engaged.’</p>

<p>There is no doubt she blenched at the name—momentarily,
as one may at a sudden flash of lightning. She got
up at once. ‘I think you have mistook his name, cousin.
His name is Beelzebub. He is called after his father.’
She left him holding his head, and went swiftly towards
the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>The dreary Châtelard crept after her. ‘My prince—my
lord!’</p>

<p>‘No, no; I cannot hear you now.’ She waved him off.</p>

<p>Bowing, he shivered at his plight; but ‘Courage, my
child,’ he bade himself: ‘“Not <i>now</i>,” she saith.’</p>

<p>All dancing stopped, all secret talk, all laughing, teasing,
and love-making. They opened her a broad way.
The Earl of Bothwell swept the floor with his thyrsus: he
was disguised as the Theban god. But she cried out the
more vehemently, ‘No, no! I am pressed; I cannot hear
you now. You cannot avail me any more,’ and flashed
through the doorway. ‘Send me Livingstone to my
closet,’ she called over her shoulder, ‘and send me Lethington.’
She ran up her privy stair, and waited for her
servants, tapping her foot, irresolute, in the middle of the
floor.</p>

<p>Mary Livingstone flew in breathless. ‘What is it?
What is it, my lamb?’</p>

<p>‘Get me a great cloak, child, and hide up all this
foolery; and let Mr. Secretary wait until I call him.’</p>

<p>Mary Livingstone covered her from neck to foot, took
off the scarlet cap, coifed her head seemly, brought a stool
for her feet: hid the boy in the lady, you see, and all done
without a word, admirable girl!</p>

<p>The Queen had been in a hard stare the while. ‘Now
let me see M. de Lethington. But stay you with me.’</p>

<p>‘Ay, till they cut me down,’ says Livingstone, and
fetched in the Secretary.</p>

<p>She began at once. ‘I find, Mr. Secretary, that there
is room for more knaves yet in Scotland.’</p>

<p>‘Alack, madam,’ says he, ‘yes, truly. They can lie
close, do you see, like mushrooms, and thrive the richlier.
Knaves breed knavishly, and Scotland is a kindly nurse.’</p>

<p>‘There are likely to be more. Here hath the Duke
married his daughter, and the Lord of Huntly that brave
son of his whom of late he offered to me. Is this knavery
or the ecstasy of a fool? What! Do they think to win
from me by insult what they have not won by open
dealing?’</p>

<p>Mr. Secretary, who had known this piece of news for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
month or more, did not think it well to overact surprise.
He contented himself with, ‘Upon my word!’ but added,
after a pause, ‘This seems to me rash folly rather than a
reasoned affront.’</p>

<p>The Queen fumed, and in so doing betrayed what had
really angered her. ‘Knave or fool, what is it to me? A
false fine rogue! All rogues together. Ah, he professed
my good service, declared himself worthy of trust—declared
himself my lover! Heavens and earth, are lovers here of
this sort?’</p>

<p>Mary Livingstone stooped towards her. ‘Think no
more of him—ah me, think of none of them! They seek
not your honour, nor love, nor service, but just the sweet
profit they can suck from you.’</p>

<p>The Queen put her chin upon her two clasped hands.
‘I have heard my aunt, Madame de Ferrara, declare,’ she
said, with a metallic ring in her voice which was new to it,
‘that in the marshes about that town the peasant women,
and girls also, do trade their legs by standing in the lagoon
and gathering the leeches that fasten upon them to suck
blood. These they sell for a few pence and give their
lovers food. But my lovers in Scotland are the leeches;
so here stand I, trading myself, with all men draining me
of profit to fatten themselves.’</p>

<p>‘Madam——’ said Lethington quickly, then stopped.</p>

<p>‘Well?’ says the Queen.</p>

<p>‘I would say, madam, the fable is a good one. Gather
your leeches and sell them for pence. Afterwards, if it
please you, trade no more in the swamps, but royally, in a
royal territory. Ah, trade you with princes, madam! I
hope to set up a booth for your Majesty’s commerce, and
to find a chafferer of your own degree.’</p>

<p>She understood very well that he spoke of an English
alliance for her, and that this was not to be had without a
husband of English providing. ‘I think you are right,’
she replied. ‘If the Queen of England, my good sister,
come half-way towards me, I will go the other half. This
you may tell to Mr. Randolph if you choose.’</p>

<p>‘Be sure that I tell him, madam.’</p>

<p>‘Good dreams to you, Mr. Secretary.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>‘And no dreams at all to your Majesty—but sweet,
careless sleep!’</p>

<p>The Queen, turning for consolation to her Livingstone,
won the relief of tears. They talked in low tones to each
other for a little while, the mistress’s head on the maid’s
shoulder, and her two hands held. The Queen was out
of heart with Scotland, with love, with all this skirting of
perils. She was for prudence just now—prudence and
the English road. Then came in the tirewoman for the
unrobing, and then a final argument for England.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Châtelard, who truly (as he had told Des-Essars)
was a foredoomed man, lay hidden at this moment
where no man should have lain unsanctified. I shall not
deal with him and his whereabouts further than to say that,
just as Frenchmen are slow to see a joke, so they are loath
to let it go. He had proposed on this, of all nights of the
year, to push his joke of the ballroom into chamber-practice.
Some further silly babble about ‘wifely duty’
was to extenuate his great essay. If jokes had been his
common food, I suppose he would have known the smell
of a musty one. As it was, he had to suffer in the fire
which old Huntly and his Hamilton-marriage had lit: his
joke was burnt up as it left his lips. For the Queen’s
words, when she found him, clung about him like flames
about an oil-cask, scorched him, blistered him, shrivelled
him up. He fell before them, literally, and lay, dry with
fear, at her discretion. She spurned him with her heel.
‘Oh, you weed,’ she said, ‘not worthy to be burned, go, or
I send for the maids with besoms to wash you into the
kennel.’ He crept away to the shipping next day, pressing
only the hand of Des-Essars, who could hardly refuse him.
‘His only success on this miserable occasion,’ the young
man wrote afterwards, ‘was to divert the Queen’s rage from
Monsieur de Gordon, and to turn her thoughts, by ever so
little more, in the direction of the English marriage. He
was one of those fools whose follies serve to show every
man more or less ridiculous, just as a false sonnet makes
sonneteering jejune.’</p>

<p class="tb">Lent opened, therefore, with omens; and with more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
came Lady Day and the new year. The Gordons, being
summoned, did not answer; the Gordons, then, were put
to the horn. The Queen was bitter as winter against
them, with no desire but to have them at her knees. As
for lovers and their loves, after George Gordon, after the
crowning shame of Monsieur de Châtelard, ice-girdled
Artemis was not chaster than she. My Lord of Bothwell,
after an essay or two, shrugged and sought the border;
the Queen was all for high alliances just now, and Mr.
Secretary, their apostle, was in favour. He was hopeful,
as he told Mary Fleming, to see two Queens at York; and
who could say what might not come of that? And while
fair Fleming wondered he was most hopeful, for like a
delicate tree he needed genial air to make him bud. You
saw him at such seasons at his best—a shrewd, nervous
man, with a dash of poetry in him. The Queen of England
always inspired him; he was frequently eloquent upon the
theme. His own Queen talked freely about her ‘good
sister,’ wrote her many civil letters, and treasured a few
stately replies. One wonders, reading them now, that
they should have found warmer quarters than a pigeon-hole,
that they could ever have lain upon Queen Mary’s
bosom and been beat upon by her ardent heart. Yet so
it was. They know nothing of Queen Mary who know
her not as the Huntress, never to be thrown out by a cold
scent. Mr. Secretary, knowing her well, harped as long as
she would dance. ‘Ah, madam, there is a golden trader!
Thence you may win an argosy indeed. What a bargain
to be struck there! Sister kingdoms, sister queens—oh,
if the Majesty of England were but lodged in a man’s
heart! But so in essence it is. Her royal heart is like a
strong fire, leaping within a frame of steel. And your
Grace’s should be the jewel which that fire would guard,
the <i>Cor Cordis</i>, the Secret of the Rose, the Sweetness in
the Strong!’</p>

<p>Mary Fleming, glowing to hear such periods, saw her
mistress catch light from them.</p>

<p>‘You speak well and truly,’ said Queen Mary. ‘I would
I had the Queen of England for my husband; I would
love her well.’ She spoke softly, blushing like a maiden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Sister and spouse!’ cries Lethington with ardour.
‘Sister and spouse!’</p>

<p>For the sake of some such miraculous consummation
she gave up all thoughts of Don Carlos, put away the
Archduke, King Charles, the Swedish prince. Her sister
of England should marry her how she would. Lethington,
on the day it was decided that Sir James Melvill should go
to London upon the business, knelt before his sovereign in
a really honest transport, transfigured in the glory of his
own fancy. ‘I salute on my knees the Empress of the
Isles! I touch the sacred stem of the Tree of the New
World!’</p>

<p>Very serious, very subdued, very modest, the Queen
cast virginal eyes to her lap.</p>

<p>‘God willing, Mr. Secretary, I will do His pleasure in
all things,’ she said.</p>

<p>The Lord James, observing her melting mood, made a
stroke for the Earldom of Moray. Were the Gordons to
defy the Majesty of Scotland? With these great hopes
new born, with old shames dead and buried—never, never!
The Queen said she would go to the North and hound the
Gordons out.</p>

<h3 id="I_CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="smaller">GORDON’S BANE</span></h3>

<p>On the morning of Lammas Day the Queen heard mass in
the Chapel Royal with a special intention, known only to
herself. Red mass it should have been, since she felt sore
need of the Holy Ghost; but she had given up the solemn
ornament of music for the sake of peace. So Father Lesley
read the office before the very few faithful: her maids,
Erskine, Herries, the esquires, the pages, the French Ambassador,
the Ambassador of Savoy—with him a certain
large, full-blooded Italian, of whom there will be something
to say anon. Mr. Knox had been scaring off the waverers
of late: the Catholic religion was languid in the realm.</p>

<p>She knelt before the altar on her faldstool very stiffly,
and looked more solitary than she felt. Her high mood
and high endeavour still holding, there was but one man in
Scotland who could make her feel her isolation, make her
pity herself so nearly that the tears filled her eyes. Her
brother James and his party, ostentatiously aloof, she could
reckon with. All was said of them long ago by that old
friend of hers now facing God in the mass: ‘Your brother
stands on the left of your throne; but he looks for ever to
the right.’ With this key to the cipher of my Lord James,
what mystery in his sayings or doings? Then the grim
Mr. Knox, who had worked her secret desires, and since
then railed at her, scolded her, made her cry—she had his
measure too. He liked her through all, and she trusted
him in spite of all: at a pinch she could win him over.
Whom, then, need she consider? The Earl of Bothwell—ah,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
the Earl of Bothwell, who laughed at everything, and
had looked drolly on at her efforts to be a queen, and
chosen to do nothing to help or hinder: there was a man
to be feared indeed! She never knew herself less a queen
or more a girl than when he was before her. Laughed
he or frowned, was he eloquent or dumb as a fish, he
intimidated her, diminished her, drove her cowering into
herself to queen it alone. Christ was not so near, God not
so far off, as this confident, free-living, shameless lord.
Therefore now, because she dared not falter in what she
was about to do, or see herself less than she desired to be,
she had sent him into Liddesdale to hold the Justice-Court,
and had not cared even to receive him when he came to
take his leave. Lady Argyll, who had stood in her place,
reported that he had gone out gaily, humming a French
air. With him safely away, she had faced her duty—duty
of a Prince, as she conceived it. And here she knelt in
prayer, prone before the Holy Ghost—solitary (but that is
the safeguard of the King!)—and searched the altar for a
sign of assurance.</p>

<p>Over that altar hung Christ, enigmatic upon His cross.
The red priest bent his head down to his book, and made
God apace.</p>

<p>The Queen’s lips moved. ‘My Saviour Christ, I offer
Thee the intention of my heart, a clean oblation. If I do
amiss in error, O Bread of Heaven, visit it not upon me.
I have been offended, I have been disobeyed; they call
upon me to claim my just requital. But be not Thou
offended with me, my Lord, and pardon Thou my disobedience.
As for my punishment, I suffer it in seeking
to punish.’</p>

<p>It is not often that women pray in words: an urgency,
a subjection, a passionate reception is the most they do—and
the best. But she prayed so now, because she felt the
need of justifying herself before Heaven, and the ability to
do it. For Bothwell was in far Liddesdale, and she on her
throne.</p>

<p>In three days’ time she was to go to the North; and,
though the country knew it not, she would go in force to
punish the Gordons. You may judge by her prayers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
whether she was satisfied with the work. Plainly she
was not. Her anger had had time to cool; she might
have forgotten the very name of the clan, except that their
men had had honest faces, and that two of them had certainly
loved her once. But she had not been allowed to
forget: the record remained, held up ever before her eyes
in the white hand of Lord James. Contumacy! Contumacy!
Old Huntly had been traitor before, when he
trafficked with the enemies of her mother, and tried to
sell herself to the English king. The Gordons would not
surrender; they had mated with the Hamiltons, a stock
next to hers for the throne. Was there not a shameful plot
here? Would she not be stifled between these two houses?
Yes, yes, she knew all that. But they were Catholics, they
had shown her honest faces, two of them had loved her.
She was not satisfied; she must have a sign from heaven.</p>

<p>God was made, the bell proclaimed Him enthroned,
Queen Mary bowed her head. Now, now, if the Gordons
were true men, let God make a sign! The tale was told
that once, when a priest lifted up the Host above his head,
the thin film dissolved, and took flesh in the shape of a
naked child, who stood, burning white, upon the man’s
two hands. Let some such marvel fall now! Intimacies
between God and the Prince had been known. She hid
her face, laid down her soul; the vague swam over her, the
dark—a swooning, drowning sense. In that, for a moment,
as vivid clouds chased each other across her field, she saw
a face, a shape—mocking red mouth, vivacious, satirical
hands, the gleam of two twinkling eyes: Bothwell, hued
like a fiend, shadowing the world. She shuddered; God
passed over, as the bell called up the people. With them
she lifted her head, stiffened herself. The spell was broken.
Without being more superstitious than her brethren, she
may be pardoned for finding in this experience an ominous
beginning of adventure.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, she so faced the heights of her task that,
on the day appointed, she set out as bravely as to a hunting
of stags. Jeddart pikes, bowmen from the Forest, her
Lothian bodyguard—she had some five hundred men
about her; too many for a progress, too few to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
war. She herself rode in hunting trim, with two maids,
two pages, two esquires; her brother, of course, in command;
with him, of course, the Secretary. At fixed points
along the road certain lords joined her: Atholl at Stirling,
Glencairn and Ruthven at Perth, these with their companies.
Lying at Coupar-Angus, at Glamis, at Edzell, her
spirits rose as she breasted the rising country, saw the cloud-shadowed
hills, the swollen rivers, the wind-swept trees, the
sullen moors, the rocks. She grew happy even, for motion,
newness, and physical exertion always excited her, and she
was never happy unless she was excited. No fatigue
daunted her. She sat out the driving days of rain, bent
neither to the heat nor to the cold fog. She was always
in front, always looking forward, seemed like the keen
breath of war, driven before it as the wind by a rain-storm.
Lethington likened her to Diana on Taygetus
shrilling havoc; but the Lord James said: ‘Such similitudes
are distasteful. We are serious men upon a serious
business.’ She rode astraddle like a young man, longed
for a breastplate and steel bonnet. She made Ruthven
exercise her with the broadsword, teach her to stamp her
foot and cry, ‘Ha! a touch!’ and cajoled her brother into
letting her sleep one night afield. Folded in a military
plaid, so indeed she did; and watched with thrills the stars
shoot their autumn flights, and listened to the owls calling
each other as they coursed the shrew-mice over the moor.
She pillowed her head on Mary Livingstone’s knee at last,
and fell asleep at about three o’clock in the morning.</p>

<p>In the grey mirk—sharply cold, and a fine mist drizzling—Lethington
and his master came to rouse her. Mary
Livingstone lifted a finger of warning. The Queen was
soundly asleep, smiling a little, with parted lips and the
hasty breathing of a child. Mary Seton, too, was deep,
her face buried in her arm. The two men looked down at
the group.</p>

<p>‘Come away, my lord: give them time,’ said the
Secretary.</p>

<p>But my Lord James did not hear him. He stood
broodingly, muttering to himself: ‘A girl’s frolic—this
romping, fond girl! And Scotland’s neck for her footstool—and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
earnest men for her pastime. O King eternal, is it
just? Man!’ he said aloud, ‘there’s no reason in this.’</p>

<p>Mr. Secretary misunderstood him, not observing his
wild looks. ‘Give them a short half-hour, my lord. There
are two of them sleeping; and this poor watcher hath the
need of it.’</p>

<p>The Lord James turned upon him. ‘Who sought to
have women sleeping here? Are men to wait for the like
of this? Are men to wait for ever? She should have
counted the cost. I shall waken her. Ay! let her have
the truth.’</p>

<p>‘She will wake soon enough,’ says Lethington, ‘and
have the truth soon enough.’</p>

<p>The Lord James gave him one keen glance. ‘I command
here, Mr. Secretary, under the Queen’s authority.
Bid them sound.’</p>

<p>The trumpet rang; the Queen stretched herself, moved
her head, yawned, and sat up. She was wide awake
directly, laughed at Livingstone for looking so glum, at
Seton’s tumbled hair. She kissed them both, said her
prayers with Father Roche, and was ready when the order
to march was given.</p>

<p>When she came to Aberdeen she was told that a messenger
from the Earl of Huntly was waiting for her with
his chief’s humble duty, and a prayer that she would lodge
in his castle of Strathbogie. This was very insolent or
very foolish: she declined to receive the man. Let the
Earl and his son Findlater render themselves up at Stirling
Castle forthwith, she would receive them there. No more
tidings came directly; but she learned from her brother
news of the country which made her cheeks tingle. It
was the confident belief of all the Gordon kindred, she was
given to know, that her Majesty had come into the North
to marry Sir John Gordon of Findlater. He was to be
created Earl of Moray and Duke of Rothesay to that end.
True news or false, she was in the mood to believe it, and
cried out, with hot tears in her eyes, that she could have no
peace until that rogue’s head was off. Needing no prompter
at her side, she took instant action, marched on Inverness
and summoned the keys of the castle. They told her that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
the Lord of Findlater was keeper; none could come in but
by his leave. Findlater! But the man was out of his
mind! She grew very quiet when, after many repetitions
of it, she could bring herself to believe this report; then
she sent for Lethington and bade him raise the country.
The counsel was her brother’s, and meant that the clans—Forbeses,
Grants, MacIntoshes—were to be supported and
turned against the Gordons. The Lord James considered
that his work was as good as done. So did the captain of
the castle of Inverness; and rightly, for when his charge
was surrendered he was hanged. The town did its best to
appease the Queen with humble addresses and crocks full
of gold pieces; but she concealed from nobody now that
she had come up with war in her hands. Captains and their
levies were sent for from the south; roads marked out for
Kirkcaldy of Grange, Lord John Stuart, Hay of Ormiston;
rendezvous given at Aberdeen. And presently she went
down to meet them, full of the purpose she had.</p>

<p>Old Huntly came out to watch. They saw his men,
some hundred or more, in loose order at the ford of Spey.
Queen Mary’s heart leapt for battle, real crossing of swords
to crown all this feigning and waiting; but the enemy drew
off to the woods, and nobody barred her road to Aberdeen.
Uncomfortably for herself, she lodged at Spynie on the
way, where Bishop Patrick of Moray made her very welcome.
He was Lord Bothwell’s uncle, true Hepburn, a
scapegrace old Catholic, <i>anathema</i> to the good Lord James,
and proud of it. Something of Bothwell’s gleam was in his
cushioned eyes, something of Bothwell’s infectious gaiety
in his rich laugh. Like Bothwell, too, he was a mocker,
who saw things sacred and profane a uniform, ridiculous
drab, shrugged at the ruin of the faith in Scotland, and
supposed Huntly had been paid to be a traitor. The
Queen’s fine temper made her sensitive to depreciation of
the things she strove at; under such rough fingers she was
bruised. She felt cheapened by her intercourse with this
bishop; and not only so, but her business sickened her.
The old pagan made light of it.</p>

<p>‘’Tis but a day in the hedgerows for ye, madam. Send
your terriers—Lethington and siclike—into the bury, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
shall see the Gordons bolt to your nets like rabbits, and
old Huntly squealing loudest of all.’</p>

<p>Now, the Gordons had been fair in her sight, noble
friends and hardy foes. But if George Gordon was to
squeal like a rabbit, then war was playing at soldiers, and
she a tomboy out for a romp. She left Spynie feeling
that she hated the Gordons, hated their fault, hated their
chastisement, and hated above all men under the tent-roof
of heaven the whole race of Hepburn.</p>

<p>‘Vile, vile scoffers at God and His vicars! They make
a toy of me, these Hepburns. Uncle and nephew—I am a
plaything for them.’</p>

<p>‘Just a Honeypot, madam,’ said Livingstone, and was
snapped at for her respect.</p>

<p>‘Am I “Madam” to you now? What have I done to
make you so petulant?’</p>

<p>‘I wish you would be more “Madam” to the Hepburns,’
replied the maid. ‘I could curse the whole brood of
them.’</p>

<p class="tb">John Gordon defended two good castles, Findlater and
Auchindoune. He expected, and was prepared for, a siege;
but when the reinforcements came up from the Lowlands,
somewhat to his consternation the Queen joined them at
Aberdeen and hung about that region indefinitely, as if
the autumn were but begun. Perhaps the suspense, the
menace, told on old Huntly’s nerves; at any rate, something
brought him to his knees. He sent petition after
petition, promise upon promise; was reported by Ormiston
to be very much aged, tremulous, given to sobbing, and
when not so engaged, incoherent. This worthy went to
Strathbogie, hoping to surprise him; failed to find him at
home, but saw the Countess and a young girl, strangely
beautiful, the Lady Jean, sole unmarried daughter of the
house. The Countess took him into the chapel.</p>

<p>‘Do you see that, Captain Hay?’ says she.</p>

<p>‘What in particular, ma’am?’</p>

<p>There were lighted candles on the altar, a cross, the
priest’s vestments of cloth of gold laid ready. She pointed
to these adornments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>‘There is why they hunt us down, Captain Hay, because
my lord is a faithful Christian gentleman. And woe,’ cried
she, ‘woe upon her who, following wicked counsels, persecutes
her own holy religion! It had been better for her
that she had never been born. Tell your mistress that.
Tell her that Gordon’s bane is her own bane. Ah, tell
her that.’</p>

<p>He repeated the piece to the Queen in council, and she
received it in a cold silence, looking furtively round about
her at the lords present, for all the world (says Hay of
Ormiston) as if she would see whether they believed the
words or not. Her brother sat on her left, Morton the
Chancellor on her right; Argyll was there, Ruthven, Atholl,
Cassilis, Eglinton. Not one of them looked up from the
table, or saw her anxious peering. Atholl whispered
Cassilis without moving his head, and Cassilis nodded and
stared on. What did she think during that constrained
silence? Gordon’s bane her own bane! Could it be true?
Perhaps the gibe of old Bishop Hepburn came to her timely
help: ‘Rabbits in a bury, and old Huntly squealing first
and loudest.’</p>

<p>She threw up her head, like a fretful horse. ‘My lords,’
she said in her ringing, boyish voice, ‘you have heard the
message sent me by the Countess of Huntly. I am not of
her mind. Gordon has tried to be my bane, but is not so
now. I think Gordon’s bane is Gordon’s self, and fear not
what he can do against me. And if not I, why need you
fear? Take order now, how best to make an end of it all.’
Order was taken.</p>

<p>Huntly was summoned before the council, and sent his
wife. The Queen would not see her. The royal forces
moved out of Aberdeen; John Gordon cut to pieces an
outlying party; then the Earl joined hands with his son,
and the pair marched on Aberdeen. The fight was on the
rolling hills of Corrichie, down in the swampy valley
between, over and up a burn. Their cry of ‘Aboyne!
Aboyne!’ bore the Gordons into battle; their pride made
them heroic; their pride caused them to fall. It was a
case, one of the first, of the ordnance against the pipes.
No gallantry—and they were gallant; no screaming of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
music, no slogan nor sword-work, nor locking of arms,
could hold out against Kirkcaldy’s cannon or Lord James’s
horse. They huddled about their standard and so died;
some few fled into the lonely hills; but Huntly was taken,
and two of his tall sons, and all three brought to the Queen.
John of Findlater and Adam were in chains; the old man
needed none, for he was dead. They say that when he
was taken he was frantic, struggled with his captors to the
last, induced so an apoplexy, stiffened and died in their
arms. They guessed by the weight of him that he was
dead. All this they told her. She neither looked at the
body nor chose to see the two prisoners; received the news
in dull silence. ‘Where is the Lord Gordon?’ She did
ask that; and was told that he had not been engaged.</p>

<p>‘Coward as well as traitor,’ she gloomed; ‘what else is
left him to adorn?’</p>

<p>‘Madam, tumbril and gallows,’ croaked Ruthven, like a
hoody crow.</p>

<p>Next morning she awoke utterly disenchanted of the
whole affair. Nothing would content her but to be quit of
it. ‘I seem to smell of blood and filthy reek,’ she said to
her brother James. ‘Take what measures you choose.
Ruin the ruins to your heart’s content. The house was
Catholic, and I suppose the stones and mortar are abominable
in your eyes. Pull them down; do as you choose—but
let me go.’</p>

<p>He asked her desire concerning the prisoners. This
caught villain Findlater, for instance.</p>

<p>‘You seek more blood?’ she asked bitterly. ‘Take his,
then. He has had his fill of it in his day; now let him
afford you a share.’</p>

<p>Adam Gordon? She took fire at his name. ‘You shall
not touch a hair of his head. I do not choose—I will not
suffer it. He is for me to deal with.’</p>

<p>He swore that she should be obeyed; but she called in
Lethington, and put the lad in his personal charge, to be
brought after her to Stirling. At this time Lethington was
the only man she could trust.</p>

<p>Lastly, her brother hinted at the reward of his humble
services to her realm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Oh, yes, yes, brother, you shall have your bonny earldom.
God knows how you have wrought for it. But if
you keep me here one more hour, I declare I shall bestow
it on Mr. Secretary.’</p>

<p>He thanked her, saying that he hoped to deserve such
condescension by ever closer attention to her business.
She chafed and fidgeted till he was gone, then set about
her escape. With a very small escort, she pushed them to
the last extreme in her anxiety to be south.</p>

<p>There should have been something of the pathetic in
this struggle of a girl to get out of throne-room and council-chamber;
one might almost hear the shrilling of wings;
but Scots gentlemen fearful of their treadings must be
excused for disregarding it. They told her at Dundee
that the Duke of Châtelherault lay there, awaiting her
censures. Hateful reminder!</p>

<p>‘What can he want with me at such an hour, in such a
place as this?’</p>

<p>‘Madam, it is for his son-in-law’s sake he hath come
so far.’</p>

<p>She flamed forth in her royalest rage. ‘Is the Lord
Gordon so poor in heart? Can he not beg for himself?
Can he not lie? Can he not run? He can hide himself,
I know, while his kinsmen take the field. Let him learn to
whine also, and then he will be armed <i>cap-à-pie</i>.’ The old
Duke was refused: let the Lord Gordon surrender himself
at Stirling Castle.</p>

<p>Thither went she, shivering in the cold which followed
her late fires; and sat in the kingly seat to make an end of
the Gordons. Thither then came the young lord whom
she had once chosen to bewitch, walking upright, without
his sword. He could not take his eyes from her face when
he stood before her; nor could she restrain her fury, though
many were present; no, but she leaned forward, holding
by the balls of the chair, and drove in her hateful words
fiercely and quick.</p>

<p>‘Ah, false heart, you dare to meet me at last!’</p>

<p>He said, ‘I have offended you, and am here at your
mercy.’</p>

<p>‘What mercy for a liar?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>‘There should be none.’</p>

<p>‘For a disobedient servant?’</p>

<p>‘None, madam, none.’</p>

<p>‘For a craven that hides when war is adoing?’</p>

<p>He answered her steadily. ‘Whether is that man the
greater coward who fears such taunts as these, and for fear
of them does hardily; or he that refuses to draw sword
upon his sovereign, though she throw in his face his refusal?
If I was able to dare your enmity, it is a small thing to me
that now I must have your scorn. There is no man in this
place shall call me craven; but from your Majesty I care not
to receive the name, because I am proud to have deserved it.’</p>

<p>This was well spoken, had she not been too fretful to
know it.</p>

<p>‘Do you think, sir,’ cried she, ‘to scold me? Do you
think me so light as to forget? I am of longer memory
than you. Trust Gordon, said you! Trust Gordon? I
would as lief trust Judas that sold his master, or Zimri that
slew his.’</p>

<p>Young Gordon held his peace, not knowing how to
wrangle with a woman. At the door there was some commotion—hackbutters
looking about for orders, the captain
of the guard forbidding the entry, his hand uplifted to shut
men out. They told her that Lady Huntly was there.</p>

<p>‘Let her in,’ says the Queen. ‘I will show her this son
of hers.’</p>

<p>The widow came, feeling her way down the hall; distracted
with grief, using her hands like a blind man.
Beside her, really leading her, was a tall girl, exceedingly
handsome, dark-haired, pale, with proud, shut lips. She
looked before her, at nothing in particular—neither at the
young Queen stormy on her throne, nor at the circle of
watchful men about her, nor at her brother’s bowed head,
nor at the full doorways. She saw nothing, seemed to
take no part, to feel no shame. Except the Queen only,
she seemed the youngest there; with the Queen, whose
eyes she held from the beginning, she was the only girl
among these grim-regarding men.</p>

<p>‘Who is that? Who is that girl?’ the Queen asked
Lethington, without ceasing to look.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Madam, it is the Lady Jean Gordon.’</p>

<p>‘She has a frozen look, then. Why does she not see
me? Is she blind?’</p>

<p>‘They say she is proud, madam.’</p>

<p>‘Proud? What, to be a Gordon?’</p>

<p>She watched her the whole time of the process, finding
her a cold copy of her brother, admitting freely her great
beauty, admiring (while she grudged) her impassivity.
She herself was all on edge, quivering and intense as a
blown flame, her face hued like the dawn, her eyes frosty
bright. The other was so still! But the Queen was never
quiet. Her eyelids fluttered, the wings of her nose; her
foot tapped the stool; she saw everything, heard every
breath. Jean Gordon had no colour, and might have been
carved in stone—a sightless, patient and dumb goddess,
staring forward out of a temple porch. Huddling in her
great chair, resting her chin on her hand, her elbow on her
knee, Queen Mary watched her closely, sensing an enemy;
and all this while Lady Huntly called upon God and man
to testify to Gordon’s bane.</p>

<p>‘Malice,’—thus she ended her wailing,—‘Malice hath
wrought this woe; far-reaching, insatiable malice! There
was one that craved a fair earldom, and another the fair
trappings of a house: there was one must have the land,
and another the good blood. Foul fare they all—they
have their desires in this world! Where is Huntly? He
is dead. Where is my fine son John? Dead! dead!
Where is Adam, my pretty boy? Fetters on his ankles,
madam, the rats at his young knees. Come, come, come:
you shall have all the Gordons. There you have the heir,
and here the widow, and here the fatherless lass. Let
them plead for your mercy if they care. I have no voice
left but a cry, and no tears but bloody tears. What should
I weep but blood?’</p>

<p>The Queen still looked at Jean Gordon. ‘Do you
plead, mistress?’ she asked her.</p>

<p>‘I do not, madam.’</p>

<p>She turned unwillingly to Gordon. ‘What do you
plead, sir?’</p>

<p>‘Nothing, madam.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>She flew out at them all. ‘Insolence! This is not to
be borne. You think to save your faces by this latter
pride. You should have been proud before—proud enough
not to promise and to lie. You expect me to be humble,
to sue you to plead! If my mercy is not worth your
asking, it is not worth your receiving. My Lord Gordon,
surrender yourself to the law’s discretion. Madam, you
gain nothing by your reproaches; and you, young mistress,
nothing by your silence. The council is dissolved.’</p>

<p>Lord Gordon walked into ward. The Queen told Lethington
that all the forms of law must be observed; by
which Lord Gordon’s execution was to be understood.</p>

<p>When she reached Holyrood she sent for Adam Gordon:
this shows you that a thaw had set in. She received him
in private, alone. This proves that she wanted something
yet from the Gordons.</p>

<p>The lad stood shamefully by the door, red with shame,
and by shame made sullen. But the Queen had melted
before he came; the tears stood waiting in her eyes. ‘Oh,
Adam, Adam Gordon, they have hurt you! And you
have hurt me!’ She held out her arms.</p>

<p>He looked at her askance, he fired up, he gulped a sob;
and then he jumped forward into the shelter of her and
cried his heart out upon her bosom. After a time of
mothering and such-like, he sat by her knee and told her
everything.</p>

<p>His father’s exorbitant pride, Findlater’s ambitions,
the clamours of the clan and want of ready pence, had
undone the house of Huntly. Findlater was restless. He
knew that the country would have him chief; he knew that
he was a better man than his father or the heir; and old
Huntly knew it too, and would never lag behind. His
brother Gordon, said Adam, was an honest man. For
why? He had refused to bear arms against her Majesty,
when it came to that or ruin. That hurt him so much with
the kindred that he had gone away. If he was a coward,
Adam held, such cowardice was very noble courage. ‘And
be you sure, madam, from what I am telling you, that he
loves you over-well.’</p>

<p>‘He should love his wife, my child.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>‘His wife, indeed! Not he!’ cried Adam. ‘Why, he
loved your Majesty from the very first, and begged you to
trust him. And should he go back upon his word?’</p>

<p>‘Well,’ said the Queen, smiling, ‘maybe I will try him
again.’</p>

<p>‘So please your Majesty, think of this,’ Adam said.
‘A man, they say, weds with his hand. But he loves not
with the hand.’</p>

<p>‘Would you wed with the hand, boy?’</p>

<p>He blushed. ‘I would, madam, if I must. But I would
cut it off first.’</p>

<p>The Queen was delighted with him. She asked about
his sister—was very curious. How old was his sister Jean?
She was told. Nineteen years! Younger than herself,
then—and looking so much older. Was she affianced?
Not yet? What made the men such laggards in the North?
She looked proud and cold: was she so indeed?</p>

<p>‘She is cold,’ says Adam, ‘until you warm her.’</p>

<p>‘A still girl,’ says the Queen.</p>

<p>And Adam, ‘Ay, deep and still.’</p>

<p>The Queen became pensive.</p>

<p>‘I think I might be pleased with her in time.’</p>

<p>Adam knew better. ‘No, no, madam. She is not one
for your Majesty.’</p>

<p>‘How so?’</p>

<p>‘Madam, so please your Majesty, when you love it is
easy seen, and when you hate also. All your heart beats
in your face. But Jean hides her heart. If she loves, you
will never see it. If she hates, you will never know it,
until the time comes.’</p>

<p>‘And when should that be, Adam?’</p>

<p>‘Eh,’ says he, ‘when she has you fast and sure.’</p>

<p>This singular character attracted the Queen. She
thought much of Lady Jean Gordon, and for many days.</p>

<p class="tb">Hateful ceremonies were enacted over the ruins of the
house of Huntly. The old Earl in his coffin was set up
in the Parliament-house and indicted of his life’s offence:
a brawling indeed in the quiet garden of death. They
flung shame upon the witless old head; they stripped the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
heedless old body of the insignia it wore. The Queen
made a wry face when she heard of it.</p>

<p>‘Whose is the vulture-mind in this?’ she asked, but
received no reply from her stony brother. She bade them
stop their nasty play and deliver up the corpse to Lady
Huntly to be buried. Then she learned that the widow
and her daughter and the condemned lord had been
present. She turned pale: ‘I had no hand in this—I had
no hand!’ she cried out breathlessly, and was for telling
the mourners. Adam Gordon told her that they would be
very sure of it.</p>

<p>‘Well,’ she said, ‘I will trust them to be as true-minded
as thou.’</p>

<p>She shortly refused to allow Gordon’s execution, and
told her brother so.</p>

<p>‘You and your friends,’ said she, ‘have paddled your
hands long enough. Go you to your homes and wash. The
Lord Gordon shall go to Dunbar to await my pleasure.’</p>

<p>‘Tell him,’ she said to Adam, ‘that because he asked
not his life I give it him; and say also that I trust him
to make no escape from Dunbar. Remind him of his
words to me aforetime. If I trust him again he must not
prove me a fool.’</p>

<p>They say that, at this pungent instance of royal
clemency, Lady Huntly broke down, fell before her, and
would have kissed her feet. The Queen whipped them
under her gown.</p>

<p>‘Get up, madam. But get up! That is no place for
the afflicted. You do not see your daughter there.’</p>

<p>It was very true. Lady Jean stood, composed and
serious.</p>

<p>‘How shall I find the way into that fenced heart?’
thinks the Queen.</p>

<p>But now she turned her face eagerly towards England,
whither, Mr. Secretary Lethington assured her, ran an
open, smiling road.</p>

<h3 id="I_CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="smaller">THE DIVORCE OF MARY LIVINGSTONE<br />
(<i>To an Italian Air</i>)</span></h3>

<p>The ranging eye of the Muse, sweeping up the little with
the big, rediscerns Monsieur de Châtelard, like a derelict
ladybird, tide-swept into Scotland once more. It is true,
unfortunately, that you have not yet done with this poet,
though the time is at hand.</p>

<p>He came warily pricking back in October; and, nosing
here and there, found a friend in a certain portly Italian
gentleman, by name Signior David, who professed to be
deeply attached to him on very short notice, and whose
further employment was, discoverably, that of foreign
secretary to her Majesty. Needing alliances—for his
venture was most perilous—Monsieur de Châtelard had
sought him out; and found him writing in a garret,
wrapped in ample fur. A cup of spiced wine stood by
him, a sword and toothpick lay to hand: no Italian needs
more. He was a fine, pink, fleshy man, with a red beard,
fluff of red hair in his ears, light eyelashes, blue eyes.
His hair, darker than his beard, was strenuous and tossed.</p>

<p>He was not very clean, but his teeth were admirable.
Monsieur de Châtelard, coming in with great ceremony,
credentials in hand, hoped that he might have the satisfaction
of making Signior David a present.</p>

<p>The Italian was franchise itself. ‘Per la Madonna, my
lord, you may make me many presents. I will tire you
out at that pastime.’ He ran his eye over the Marquis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
D’Elbœuf’s letter. ‘Aha, we have here Monsieur de
Châtelard, poet, and companion of princes! Sir,’ said he,
‘let two adventurous explorers salute each other. If I
were not a brave man I should not be here; still less
would your honour. A salute seems little testimony
between two such champions. You are Amadis, I am
Splandian. We should embrace, Monsieur de Châtelard.’</p>

<p>They did; the poet was much affected. ‘I come with
my life in my hands, Signior David.’</p>

<p>‘Say, rather, on the tips of your fingers, dear sir!’</p>

<p>‘You see in me,’ continued the Frenchman, ‘a brave
man. You said as much, and I thank you. But you see
more. You see a poet.’</p>

<p>‘Aha!’ cries the other, tapping his chest with one finger;
‘and here is the little fellow who will sing your verses as
merrily as you make them.’</p>

<p>‘Allow me to perorate,’ says Monsieur de Châtelard.
‘You see also, signore, a disgraced lover of the Queen,
who nevertheless returns to kiss the hand that smote him.’</p>

<p>‘<i>Sanguinaccio!</i> my good friend,’ Signior David replied:
‘I hope I don’t see a fool.’</p>

<p>Monsieur de Châtelard considered this aspiration with
that gravity it deserved. He hesitated before he made
answer. ‘I hope not, Signior David,’ he said wistfully;
‘but, as a lover, I am in some doubt. For a lover, as you
very well know, is not (by the nature of his case) many
removes from a fool. He may be—he is—a divine fool.
Fire has touched his lips, to make him mad. He speaks—but
what? Noble folly! He does—but what? Glorious
rashness!’</p>

<p>‘Undoubtedly,’ said the Italian. ‘But does he not
know—when a Queen is in the case—that he has a neck
to be wrung?’</p>

<p>‘He knows nothing of such things. This is the sum of
his knowledge—I love! I love! I love!’</p>

<p>The Italian looked at him with calmness. ‘I speak
for my nation,’ he said, ‘when I assure you that an Italian
lover knows more than that. He considers means, and
ends too. Hungry he may be; but how shall he be filled
if you slit open his belly? He may be thirsty; but if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
cut his throat? However, I am speaking into the air.
Let us be reasonable. How can I serve you, dear sir?’</p>

<p>‘Signior David,’ says the poet, ‘I shall speak openly
to you. Howsoever brave a man may be, howsoever
dedicated to impossible adventure, there is one wind which,
blowing through the forest, must chill him to the heart.
It is the wind of Indifference. By heaven, sir, can you
sing before mutes, or men maimed of their hands? And
how are you and I to do admirable things, if no one
admires, or cares whether we do them or not? The
thought is absurd. Here, in this grey Scotland, which is
Broceliande, the enchanted forest hiding my princess, I
suffer acutely from my solitude. Formerly I had friends;
now I have none. Sir, I offer you my friendship, and ask
yours again. Be my friend. Thus you may serve me, if
you will.’</p>

<p>The Italian took up the fringe of his beard and brushed
his nose with it. ‘I must know one little thing first.
What do you want with your enchanted princess in the
middle of your forest? Everything?’</p>

<p>Monsieur de Châtelard opened wide his arms, strained
them forward, clasped them over his bosom, and hugged
himself with them.</p>

<p>‘Everything,’ he said; and the Italian nodded, and sank
into thought.</p>

<p>‘If I assist you to that, good sir,’ says he presently,
looking at his client, ‘it will be a very friendly act on my
part.’</p>

<p>‘Sir,’ replied the Frenchman, ‘I require a friendly act.’</p>

<p>Signior David looked down, ever so lightly, at the
jewel in his hand, which the poet had put there. ‘But!’
and he raised his eyebrows over it, ‘it will be impossible
for future rhapsodists to devise an act more friendly than
this! It might be—I do not say that it will be, for I
am a simple scribe, as you see—it might be a partaking
which Achilles would never have allowed to Patroclus.’</p>

<p>‘But you, signore, are not Achilles,’ urged Monsieur de
Châtelard.</p>

<p>The Italian shrugged. ‘I have not yet found Achilles
in this country; but many have offered themselves to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Patroclus. ‘Come,’ he added, with a pleasant grin, ‘Come,
I will serve you. We will be friends. For the moment I
recommend discretion. Her Majesty returned but two days
ago, and is already in the midst of affairs. This annoys
her extremely. She thought she had done with business
and might begin her dancing. But I cannot think that
she will dance very long, the way matters are tending.’</p>

<p>Monsieur de Châtelard went away, to brace himself for
the opening scene of a new act. He came often back
again to see his friend, to submit to his judgment such
and such a theory. How should the lover encounter his
mistress, against whose person he had dared, but not dared
enough, the storming of the sweet citadel? Here was the
gist of all his inquiry.</p>

<p>‘Show yourself, dear sir, show yourself!’ was his friend’s
advice, whose own tactics consisted in never showing
himself and in making his absence felt.</p>

<p>The Frenchman, finally, did show himself, with very
little result one way or the other. The Queen, occupied as
she had been with Huntly’s ruin, and now with the patching
up of a comfortable fragment out of it, hardly knew that
he was there. This was the way of it. A lightly-built
young man with a bush of crimped hair sprang out of the
press in hall at the hour of the <i>coucher</i>, and fell upon his
knees. ‘Ha, Monsieur de Châtelard, you return?’ If she
smiled upon him, it was because she smiled on all the
world when the world allowed it.</p>

<p>‘Sovereign, the poor minstrel returns!’</p>

<p>‘I hope he will sing more tunefully. I hope he will
follow the notes.’</p>

<p>‘All the notes of the gamut, Princess; faithfully and to
the utterance.’</p>

<p>She nods and goes her way, to think no more about
him.</p>

<p>From this unsubstantial colloquy, the infatuated gentleman
drew the highest significance. Why, what are the
notes of the chant which a lover must follow? There is
but one note; the air is a wailing monotone: <i>Hardiesse,
Hardiesse, Hardiesse!</i> O Queen, potent in Cyprus, give
your vassal effrontery!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Amantium iræ!</i> She had hopes that the piping times
were come, with an air cleaner for the late storms. She
had won back young Adam Gordon, as you know, and
sealed him to her by kisses and tears. She had hopes
of his elder brother, now a faithful prisoner at Dunbar.
James Earl of Moray proved a kinder brother than Lord
James Stuart had ever been; Ruthven was gorged, somnolent
now, like a sated eagle, above the picked bones of
Huntly. Morton was at Dalkeith, out of sight, out of
mind; Mr. Secretary wrote daily to England, where Sir
James Melvill haggled with bridegrooms; Mr. Knox reported
his commission faithfully done. He had laboured,
he said, and not in vain. Her Majesty knew that the two
lords, Bothwell and Arran, had been reconciled. He took
leave to say that, since her expedition to the North, he had
rarely seen a closer band of friendship between two men,
seeming dissimilar, than had been declared to every eye
between the Earls Arran and Bothwell.</p>

<p>The news was good, as far as it went; it made for the
peace which every sovereign lady must desire. So much
she could tell Mr. Knox, with truth and without trouble.
But—but—the Earl of Bothwell came not to the Court.
He had been seen in town, in September, when she was
fast in the hills; he was now supposed to be at Hailes;
had been at Hamilton, at Dumbarton, at Bothwell in
Clydesdale. Why should he absent himself? If by staying
away he hoped to be the more present, he had his
desire. The Queen grew very restless, and complained of
pains in the back. What he could have had to do with
these is not clear; but the day came very soon when she
had a pain in the side—his work.</p>

<p>That was a day when there was clamour in the quadrangle,
sudden rumour: the raving of a man, confused
comment, starting of horses, grounding of arms; the guard
turned out. The Queen was at prayers—which is more
than can be said for the priest who should have lifted up
her suffrages; for if she prayed the mass through, he did
not. The poor wretch thought the Genevans were after
him, and his last office a-saying. Whatever she thought,
Queen Mary never moved, even though (as the fact was)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
she heard quick voices at the chapel doors, and the shout,
‘Hold back those men!’</p>

<p>She found Lethington waiting in the antechapel when
she entered it. He was perturbed.</p>

<p>‘Well, Mr. Secretary, what have my loving subjects
now on hand?’</p>

<p>He laughed his dismay. ‘Madam, here is come, with
foam on his lips, my Lord of Arran, the Duke’s son.’</p>

<p>‘Doth he foam so early?’ says she. ‘Give him a
napkin, and I will see him clean.’</p>

<p>Presently they admitted the disordered man, frowning
and muttering, much out of breath, and his hair all over
his face. Kirkcaldy of Grange held his arm; the Secretary
and Lord Lindsay hovered about him; through the
half-open door there spied the anxious face of Des-Essars.</p>

<p>‘Speak, my Lord Arran,’ says the Queen.</p>

<p>‘God save us all, I must, I must!’ spluttered Arran,
and plunged afresh upon his nightmare.</p>

<p>If that can be called speech which comes in gouts of
words, like tin gobbling of water from a neck too narrow,
then Lord Arran spoke. He wept also and slapped his
head, he raved, he adjured high God—all this from his
two knees. Mystery! He had wicked lips to unlock.
He must reveal horrid fact, devilish machination, misprision
of treason! God knew the secret of his heart; God knew
he would meet that bloody man half-way. In that he
was a sinner, let him die the death. Oh, robber, curious
robber! To dare that sacred person, to encompass it with
greedy hands—robbery! God is not to be robbed—and
who shall dare rob the King, anointed of God? Such a
man would steal the Host from the altar. Sorcery!
sorcery! sorcery!</p>

<p>When he stopped to gasp and roll his eyeballs in their
sockets, the Queen had her opportunity. She was already
fatigued, and hated noises at any time. ‘Hold your words,
my lord, I beg of you. Who is your bloody man? Who
steals from a king, and from what king steals he? Who is
your sorcerer, and whom has he bewitched? Yourself, by
chance?’</p>

<p>Arran turned her the whites of his eyes—a dreadful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
apparition. ‘The Earl of Bothwell’—he spoke it in a
whisper—‘the Earl of Bothwell did beguile me.’</p>

<p>‘Then I think he did very idly,’ said the Queen. ‘He
has been profuse of his sorcery. Tell your tale to the Lord
of Lethington, and spare me.’</p>

<p>And away she went in a pet. Let the Earl of Bothwell
come to her or not, she did not choose to get news of him
through a fool.</p>

<p>Yet the fool had had seed for his folly. He was
examined, produced witnesses; and his story bore so black
a look that the council confined him on their own discretion
until the Queen’s pleasure could be known. Then her
brother, Mr. Secretary and others came stately into her
cabinet with their facts. Mr. Knox, said they, had waited
upon the Earl of Bothwell to urge a reconciliation with Lord
Arran. The Hepburn had been very willing, had laughed
a good deal over the cause of enmity—a kiss to a pretty
woman, etc.—in a friendly manner. The two lords had
met, certain overtures were made and accepted. Very well;
her Majesty had observed with what success Mr. Knox had
done his part. But wait a little! Friendship grew apace,
until at last it seemed that the one Earl cared not to lose sight
of the other. Incongruous partnership! but there were
reasons. A few weeks later my Lord of Bothwell invites
his friend to supper, and then and there proposes the
ravishment of the Queen’s person—no less a thing!</p>

<p>At this point of the recital her hand, which had been very
fidgety, went up to her lip, pinched and held it.</p>

<p>‘Continue, my lord,’ she said, ‘but—continue!’</p>

<p>‘I am slow to name what I have been slow to believe,’
says my lord of Moray, conscious of his new earldom, ‘and
yet I can show your Majesty the witness.’</p>

<p>The plan had been to surprise her on her way from Perth
to the South, take her to Hamilton, and marry her there by
force to the Earl of Arran. Bothwell was to have been
made Chancellor for his share. He had asked no greater
reward. The Queen looked down to her lap when she
heard this. What more? My lord of Arran concealed his
alarms for the moment, and told no one; but the secrecy,
the weight of the burden, worked upon him until he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
not bear himself. Before the plot was ripe he had confessed
it to half-a-dozen persons. Bothwell threatened him ravenously;
his mind gave way—hence his frantic penance.
Here was a budget of treason for the Queen to take in her
hands, and ponder, wildly and alone. Alone she pondered
it, in spite of all the shocked elders about her.</p>

<p>If he had done it! If he had—if he had! Ah, the
adventure of it, the rush of air, the pounding horse, and the
safe, fierce arms! Marry her to Arran, forsooth, and
possess her at his magnificent leisure: for of course that
was the meaning of it. Arran and his Hamiltons were dust
in the eyes of Scotland, but necessary dust. He could not
have moved without them. Thus, then, it was planned—and
oh! if he had done it! So well had she learned to
school her face that not a man of them, watching for it,
expecting it, could be sure for what it was that her heart
beat the tattoo, and that the royal colours ran up the staff
on the citadel, and flew there, straining to the gale. Was
it maiden alarm, was it queenly rage, that made her cheeks
so flamy-hot? It was neither: she knew perfectly well
what it was. And what was she going to do in requital of
this scandalous scheme? None of them knew that either;
but she again knew perfectly well what she was about. She
was about to give herself the most exquisite pleasure in life—to
deal freely, openly, and as of right, with her secret joy;
to handle in the face of all men the forbidden thing, and to
read into every stroke she dealt her darling desire. None
would understand her pleasure, none could forbid it her;
for none could under-read her masked words. And her
face, as glacial-keen as Athena’s, like Antigone’s rapt for
sacrifice; her thoughtful, reluctant eyes, her patient smile,
clasped hands, considered words—a mask, a mask! Hear
the sentences as they fell, like slow, soft rain, and listen
beneath for the exulting burthen: ‘If he had! Oh, if
he had!’</p>

<p>‘My lords, this is a fond and foolish adventure, proceeding
from a glorious heart to a distempered head. My
dignity may suffer by too serious care for it. But as I may
not permit any subject of mine to handle my person, to deal
familiarly with my person, even in thought, I must take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
as much notice of it as the fact deserves. Let the Lords
Arran and Bothwell be committed to ward during pleasure.
Prepare such writs as are needful. They shall see my sign-manual
upon them.’</p>

<p>She rose, they with her, and went across to the curtain
of the private rooms; she held the curtain as she stayed
to look back.</p>

<p>‘Be secret, Mr. Secretary, and swift.’</p>

<p>‘I shall obey your Majesty in all things.’</p>

<p>Sitting alone and very still, she wrought her hardest to
be offended at this tale, as became a sovereign lady. She
bit her red lip over it, frowned, covered her eyes—acting
a horror which she could not feel. Resolutely then she
uncovered them again, to look it in the face and see it at
its worst. But what she saw, and exulted to see, was a
Man. And the face of the man was broad-jowled, flushed,
and had a jutting under-jaw; its mouth snarled as it
laughed, its eyes were bloodshot and hardily wicked, it
was bearded from the throat. Wicked, daring, laughing
Bothwell—hey, yes, but a Man!</p>

<p>His plot—how could she but admire it as a plot? It
was a chain of fine links. Arran was heir-presumptive,
and would hold the South; Arran’s sister married to
Huntly’s son—there’s for the North. In the midst, Bothwell
with the wittold’s wife—herself. Now, if that were
the plan, then Bothwell was her lover. Observe the plain
word: her lover, not her adoring slave. Also, if that
were the plan, and Arran a catspaw, then Bothwell would
be her master. Another plain word for a plain proposal,
with which no woman, be she chaste or frail, is altogether
offended.</p>

<p>Certainly this young woman was not offended, as she
dallied with each thought in turn—weighing, affecting to
choose. Lover! Master! This saucy, merry robber.
How should she be offended? It was only a thought.
Lancelot had loved his queen, and Tristram his. Let the
plot be put before these two to judge, Lancelot would
have laughed and Tristram grieved. Arran had been like
Tristram, and she curled her lip to think of him, and
laughed aloud as she chose for Lancelot. Ah, how can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
you be offended with Love and his masterful ways? Or
with the blithe lover, who laughs while he spoils you? It
is <i>son naturel</i>; and must we not follow our nature? Love,
which made George Gordon glum, made Bothwell merry.
He would go, humming the same southern air, to battle or
to bride-bed, to midnight robbery or the strife of love.
He was a man, do you see? They had such in France,
a plenty; but in Scotland what had they but pedlars,
hagglers, cattle-drovers, field-preachers? What other in
Scotland would have shaped such a plan as this, and
gaily opened it to a fool? The Earl of Morton, do you
suppose—that thick schemer? Her brother Moray, the
new Earl, sour, careful merchant of his store? Dead old
Huntly, John of Findlater, wordy, bickering hillmen? Or
George Gordon, chastened and contrite at Dunbar? Not
one of them, not one. Gordon was her lover—accorded.
But Gordon made eyes,—and this other, plans to carry
her off. Oh, here is the difference between a boy’s kisses
and a man’s. The one sort implies itself, the other all the
furious empery of love.</p>

<p>The slim, pale, wise young witch that she looked—sitting
here alone, spelling out her schemes, glancing sidelong
from her hazel eyes! <i>Tenez</i>, she was playing with
thoughts, like a girl hot upon a girl’s affair. Not thus
meditates a prince upon his policy! She began to walk
about, looked out of window, fingered the arras; and all
the while was urging herself to princely courses. As a
prince, she would certainly make a high alliance; as a
prince, she must show disorderly subjects that she was not
to be touched too familiarly. The man must be reminded;
prison walls would cool his fevers. Let him think of her
in confinement. When he came out she would be affianced,
perhaps wedded—safe in either case. Then it would be
lawful to see him again, and—and—oh, what a laughing
Lancelot went there!</p>

<p class="tb">She kept her own counsel, having made up her own
mind, and contrived to seem severe without being so.
The Earl of Arran was sent to Dumbarton, a nominal
confinement; but Bothwell was warded in Edinburgh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Castle, the length of a street away. ‘He is more dangerous,
it seems, the farther off he is lodged,’ she gave as her
reason. It was easy to learn that he made good cheer,
kept a generous table, saw his friends and had all the
Court news; not quite so easy to pretend not to learn it.
Yet, I suppose, she knew by the next day everything that
he had said or done overnight. Des-Essars was go-between,
not officially, of course, but as by accident.
Few beside Mary Livingstone remarked that this discreet
and demure youth was off duty for half the day at a time.
Then Bishop Hepburn, my lord’s reprobate, chuckling
uncle, came to Edinburgh, and sauntered up and down
the hill as he chose; an old hand at a game as old as
Troy town. Playing a round at cards with the Queen, he
treated the late escapade as a family failing. But this was
a false step of his: the Queen was not to be caught.</p>

<p>‘When you say that the thing was folly, you are more
cruel than I have been. I have punished your nephew for
presumption and crime, but have never accused him of
being a fool. However, since you are in a position to
judge, I am willing to take it from you.’</p>

<p>He stood corrected, but did not cease to observe. The
Queen’s circumspection filled him with wonder, and at the
same time taught him, by its accuracy, all he wanted to
know. His lesson pat, he went up to the Castle again.</p>

<p>‘Nephew,’ he said, ‘the cage-door is not set open, but
I believe you have only to turn the handle when you
please.’</p>

<p>‘I shall not turn it just yet awhile, my good lord bishop,’
said the Earl, playing a tune upon his knee; ‘I find this a
fine post of observation.’</p>

<p>It was Mary Livingstone who first found out the truth
of matters, and by plunging into the fire to save her
mistress succeeded in nothing but burning herself. When,
after a sharp examination, she learned where Des-Essars
had spent his free days, she could not contain herself.
‘Fine use for pages! Fine use!’</p>

<p>This provoked a quarrel. The Queen stamped her foot,
flung up and down, shed tears. ‘You are too masterful,
my girl, too much the husband. You mistake a game and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
play for a bout-at-issue. I do not choose to be mistressed
by a maid of honour. There must be an end of this.’</p>

<p>Livingstone listened gravely. ‘Do with me as you
will, madam. Put me in my place. What is your
pleasure?’</p>

<p>‘To rule my people, child.’</p>

<p>‘Rule, madam, rule. Command me in anything. Forbid
me everything, but one thing.’</p>

<p>‘I shall forbid you what is unwholesome for you, and for
me also.’</p>

<p>‘You shall not forbid me to love you,’ said the maid,
very white.</p>

<p>‘Nay, that I cannot do!’ cried the Queen, laughing and
weeping at once. So they kissed.</p>

<p>But, for all that, she removed Livingstone from her side,
and chose Fleming. Mr. Secretary, acceptable widower in
that lady’s sight, rubbed his hands over the choice; and
Fleming herself was so sweetly gratified that nobody could
grudge her her promotion. She was a gentle-natured, low-voiced,
modest girl, with the meek beauty of an angel in a
Milanese picture. Older than the Queen, she looked
younger; whereas Livingstone was younger and looked
older. No doubt this one felt her fall; but, being as good
as gold and as proud as iron, she held her head the higher
for her lower degree, and smiled benevolently at the
raptures of the new favourite.</p>

<p>‘My dear,’ she said to Fleming, ‘do not think that I
grudge thee. In truth, I do not. What I said was done
advisedly. I knew what must come of it; I sought it, and
shall put up with it. I have a deal to think on, these days,
and my thoughts will be my night-company.’</p>

<p>‘She will never love me as she loves thee,’ says Fleming;
and was answered:</p>

<p>‘I care not greatly if she do or no; nor will I measure
loves with any one. Our affair the now is to get her fast
wedded.’</p>

<p>‘So saith Mr. Secretary at all hours,’ said Fleming.</p>

<p>But Livingstone tossed her head. ‘Fine he knows the
heart of a lass, your Lethington body!’</p>

<p>Fleming looked serious. ‘He hath spoken to me of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Lord of Lennox,’ she said, in a lower tone. ‘This lord is
near akin to our mistress; nearer, if the truth were known,
than the Duke. He hath a likely son in England, a noble
young man—my Lord of Darnley. The Queen of
England holds him dear, and (they say) looketh to him to
be her heir.’</p>

<p>Livingstone made an outcry. ‘Then she looketh askew!
It is well known to her and hers who the heir of England
is. Who should it be but our own lady?’</p>

<p>But Fleming persisted in her quiet way. ‘Mr. Secretary
speaks of him as a hopeful prince—having seen and had
speech with him. I do but use his own words. Sir James
Melvill writes of him. Mr. Randolph owns him to be
something, though unwillingly. And, says Mr. Secretary,
we may depend upon it that when Mr. Randolph admits
some grace in a Scots lord, there is much grace.’</p>

<p>Livingstone’s open eyes showed that the thing had to be
considered. ‘There may be some promise in all of this,’
says she. ‘What you tell me of Mr. Randolph gives me
thoughts. Had he nothing more to own? Has Mary
Beaton got nothing from him?’ English Mr. Randolph,
you must know, was apt to open his heart to Mary Beaton
when that brown siren called for it.</p>

<p>‘He told Mary Beaton,’ Fleming replied, ‘that the
Queen of England valued one lord no more than other,
until—until—I know not how to put it. In fine, he said,
that if any lord of her court was sought after by another,
then his Queen would need that lord more than any other.
Do you follow?’</p>

<p>‘Ay,’ says Livingstone, ‘I follow thee now. My lord of
Darnley, he is called? Why, let him come up then: we
can but look at him.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, my dear chuck,’ Fleming protested, ‘princes are
not wed by the eyes’ favour.’</p>

<p>‘They have the right to be,’ said her mate; ‘and it is
only thus, let me tell you, that our Queen will be well
wedded.’ She grew exceedingly serious. ‘Look you,
Fleming, she is in danger, she is dangerous. I know very
well what is passing up and down between this and the
Castle rock. Ask me not—seek not to learn. It is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
enough for her that she contract with this man or that.
I tell you, <i>she must want him</i>.’</p>

<p>Fleming blushed painfully, but there was no gainsaying
the truth. ‘It is true, she hath a great spirit.’</p>

<p>‘Ay,’ muttered Livingstone grimly, ‘and needeth a
greater.’</p>

<p>‘They say,’ Fleming continued, ‘that the Lord Darnley’s
is a royal soul.’</p>

<p>And Livingstone ended the council. ‘Let the young
man come up. We can but look at him.’</p>

<p class="tb">Mary Livingstone, the divorced, had a secret of her own,
but made very light of it. The Master of Sempill demanded
her person; said he could not be denied. Her father was
willing, and his father more than willing; yet she laughed
it all away. ‘I am husband of the Queen of Scots,’ she
said, ‘or was so yesterday. What should I do with the
Master?’</p>

<p>The old lord, her father, tapped his teeth. ‘You speak
pleasantly, daughter, of a pleasant privilege of yours.
But the Master is a proper man, who must have a better
answer.’</p>

<p>‘Let him bide till I am ready,’ says the good Livingstone.</p>

<p>‘I doubt he will do it, my lass. He may spoil.’</p>

<p>‘Then he is not worth the having, my lord,’ replied the
maid. ‘What use have I for perishable goods?’</p>

<p>The Master chose to wait; and when the Court moved
to Saint Andrews he waited in Fife.</p>

<p>The Court went thither with various great affairs in
train, whose conduct throve in that shrill air. The Queen
would work all the forenoon with Lethington and her useful
Italian, play all the rest of the day, and to bed early. She
played at housewifery: bib and tucker, gown pinned back,
all her hair close in a clean coif. The life was simple, the
air of homely keenness, the weather wintry; but the great
fire was kind. All about her made for healthy tastes;
inspired the hale beauty of a life within the allotted fence,
a taskwork smoothly done, and God well pleased in His
heaven. Lethington, a pliant man, lent himself to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Queen’s humour; Signior David was never known to be
moody; there were Adam Gordon and Des-Essars to give
their tinge of harmless romance—a thin wash, as it were,
of water-colour over the grey walls. Sir James Melvill,
too, who had been to England upon the high marriage
question, and returned, and was now to go again, arrived,
full of importance, for last words. It had come to this,
that the Queen was now to choose a husband.</p>

<p>Sir James was struck by her modest air, that of a
tutored maid who knows that she is called to matronhood.
‘<i>Ecce ancilla Domini!</i>’ In truth she was listening to
those very words.</p>

<p>‘I shall strive in all things, Sir James Melvill, to please
my good sister. Whether it be my Lord Robert<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> or my
cousin Darnley, I trust I shall satisfy my well-wishers.’</p>

<p>Soft voice, lowly eyes, timid fingers! ‘Who has been
pouring oil upon this beading wine?’ asked himself Sir
James. Who indeed, but Saint Andrew, with his frosty
sea-salt breath?</p>

<p>It was just at this time, as things fell out, that the Earl
of Lennox, father to that ‘hopeful prince’ of Mary Fleming’s
report, came to Scotland, as he said, upon a lawsuit concerning
his western lands. But some suspected another
kind of suit altogether; among whom, for the best of
reasons, were the Queen’s brother James, and the Lord of
Lethington the Secretary. Another was Signior David,
dæmonic familiar of Monsieur de Châtelard.</p>

<h3 id="I_CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="smaller">AIR OF ST. ANDREW: ADONIS AND THE SCAPEGOAT</span></h3>

<p>At Saint Andrews the Queen lodged in a plain house,
where simplicity was the rule, and she kept no state. The
ladies wore short kirtles and hoods for their heads; gossiped
with fishwives on the shore, shot at butts, rode out with
hawks over the dunes, coursed hares, walked the sands of
the bay when the sea was down. The long evenings were
spent in needlework and books; or one sang, or told a tale
of France—of <i>Garin de Montglane</i> or the <i>Enfances Vivien</i>.
Looking back each upon his life in after years, Adam
Gordon was sure that he had loved her best in her bodice
of snow and grey petticoat; Des-Essars when, with hair
blown back and eyes alight, she had led the chase over the
marsh and looked behind her, laughing, to call him nearer.
She was never mistress of herself on horseback, but stung
always by some divine tenant to be—or to seem—the most
beautiful, most baleful, most merciless of women. And
although her hues varied in the house, so did not her
powers. She was tender there to a fault, sensitive to
change as a filmy wing, with quick little touches, little
sighs, lowering of eyelids, smiles half-seen, provoking cool
lips, long searching looks. She meant no harm—but
consider Monsieur de Châtelard, drawn in as a pigeon to
the lure!—she must always bewitch something, girl or boy,
poet or little dog; and indeed, there was not one of these
youths now about her who was not crazy with love. She
chose at this time to be more with them than with the
maids; a boy at heart herself, she was just now as blowsed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
as a boy. She used to sit whispering with them; told
them much, and promised more than she told.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Châtelard—having ventured to present
himself—expanded in the sun of that Peace of Saint
Andrew until he resembled some gay prismatic bubble,
which may be puffed up to the ceiling and bob there until
it bursts. The Queen had forgiven him his trespass and
forgotten it. She resumed him on the old footing, sang
with him, let him whisper in her ear, dared greatly, and
supposed all danger averted by laughter. Having high
spirits and high health, she was in the mood to romp. So
they played country games by the light of the fire: blind
man’s buff, hot codlings, Queen o’ the Bean. You come
to close quarters at such times. You venture: it’s in the
bargain. If a Queen runs to hide she shall not blame a
poet who runs to seek—or she should not. When, in the
early spring, Mr. Secretary was gone to Edinburgh to see
the Earl of Lennox about that suit of his—lawsuit or other—the
Queen went further in her frolics. In the garden
one day she found a dry peascod intact, nine peas in it.
There is a country augury in this. Nothing would content
her but she must put it on the lintel like a dairymaid, and
sit conscious in the dusk until her fate crossed the threshold.
Anon there stepped in Monsieur de Châtelard with a song.
When the joke was made clear to him he took it gravely.
An omen, an omen!</p>

<p>The sense of freedom which you have when you have
made your election took her fancies a-romping as well as
her humours. They strayed with Lord Bothwell on the
Castle rock, they visited Lord Gordon at Dunbar. <i>Allez</i>,
all’s safe now! Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we
die; let us take pity on our lovers, since to-morrow we are
to wed. And—so we juggle with ourselves!—she wrote
an unnecessary letter to the one in order that she might
write an imprudent letter to the other.</p>

<p>‘Monsieur de Gordon,’ ran the first—and Adam carried
it to Dunbar in his bosom—‘I am content to believe that
your constancy in affliction proceedeth from a heart well-affected
towards me at this last. You will find me always
mindful of my friends, among whom I look to reckon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
yourself in time to come. Attachment to the prince
floweth only from good faith towards God. Holding to
the one, needs must it follow that you find the other.
Your brother Adam will tell you the same.—Your good
mistress, Marie R.’</p>

<p>Then she wrote this—for Des-Essars to deliver or
perish; and you may catch the throb of the pulse in the
lines of the pen:—</p>

<p>‘Monsieur de Bothwell, they tell me you deal more temperately
in these days, having more space for a little
thought the less your person is enlarged. They report
you to me as well in body, the which I must not grieve
for; but repining in mind. Can I be sorry, or wonder at
it, seeing to what gusty airs your phrenzy drove you?
This glove, which I send, is for one plain purpose. You
see, my lord, that the fingers are stiff where water hath
wetted them of late. You offended your Queen, who had
always wished you very well: the tears were for sorrow
that a heart so bold should prompt a deed so outrageous.’</p>

<p>Lord Bothwell, when he had this letter, sat looking at
it and its guest for a long while, in a stare. His mouth
smiled, but his eyes did not; and he sang softly to himself,
<i>La-la-la</i>, and a <i>la-la-laido</i>! A night or two later, by means
of the seal upon it and his uncle’s influence, he walked out
of the Castle, and was presently in the Hermitage with
Des-Essars. Hence he wrote to the Queen: ‘O Lady, O
Sovereign! I shall carry a token upon my helm, and
break lances under its whisper until I die,’—but neither
signed nor dated the letter.</p>

<p>‘Say to your mistress, boy, that I gave you this; but
breathe not a word of whence I wrote it. Disobey me,
you who know me of old, and when I come again I will
make of your skin but a leaky bottle of blood.’</p>

<p>Des-Essars gave his pledge, and kept it for some time.</p>

<p>If the Queen said nothing about all this to her maids, it
is no wonder. She had done foolishly, and knew it in part,
and took secret glory in it. At certain still hours of the
day, when she could afford herself the luxury of lonely
thought, she would go over what she had done, phrase
after phrase of her letter; recover the trembling with which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
she had put in the glove; picture its receipt, read and re-read
his words. And then, as she thought, the heat of her
cheeks burnt up all thought; and, as she stayed to feel her
heart beat, it drummed in her ears like nuptial music.
But they frightened her, these signs and wonders; she ran
away from herself—into the maids’ closet, into the hall
among the lounging men, into the windy weather—and
cooled her cheeks with the salt sea-spray, and drowned the
clamour of her heart in the rude welcome of March.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Châtelard, with the lover’s keen eye, saw
that she was fluttered, watched her everywhere. About
this time also he consulted his friend.</p>

<p>‘Monsieur de Riccio,’ he said, ‘there are signs of the
rising of sap. The birds pair, the festival of Saint Valentine
the Bishop is come and gone. Why do I linger?’</p>

<p>‘<i>Peste!</i>’ said the Italian, who had other things to think
of: ‘how should I know?’</p>

<p>‘By sympathy,’ his friend reproached him: ‘by the
stricken heart. For you also have loved.’</p>

<p>‘Dear sir,’ replied the other, stretching his long legs to
the full, ‘I have love and to spare at this time. Or put it,
I am beloved. Monsieur de Moray, her Majesty’s brother,
loves me dearly, or so he says; Monsieur de Lennox is his
rival for my favours. Ha, they kiss my hands! I am
touched; I have to decide—like a girl. To you, then, I
must briefly say, The times are ripe. Go you and anoint
for the bridal. I tell you that this very night—if you so
choose it—you may be the happiest of men.’</p>

<p>Monsieur de Châtelard lifted high his head. ‘Be sure
of my friendship for ever, Signior David.’</p>

<p>He threw his cloak over one shoulder and went out.</p>

<p>‘Pig and pig’s son!’ said Signior David, returning to his
love-letters.</p>

<p>He had two letters under his hand. One told him that
he might consider himself fortunate to have been chosen
an instrument to further the designs of Providence in this
kingdom. The Lord of Lethington (it said) was possessed
of the writer’s full mind upon a momentous step taken of
late towards the highest seat, under God, of any in the
land. ‘I cannot answer,’ it continued, ‘for what Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Secretary may discover to you upon your approaching him
with the words “Kirk and Realm” upon your lips, saving
that, whatever it be, it will be coloured with my friendship,
which hopes for yours again.’ There was no name at the
foot.</p>

<p>‘<i>Aut Moray aut diabolus!</i>’ however, said the Italian to
himself; ‘and why the devil my Lord of Moray desires his
sister to wed the heir of Lennox, I have no particle of
understanding. Maybe that he hopes to ruin her with the
English; maybe with the Scots. Certainly he hopes to
ruin her somewhere.’</p>

<p>The other letter was signed ‘freely by its author—‘Matho
Levenaxe’—and besought Signior David’s furtherance
of his son’s, the Lord Darnley’s, interests; who had
come post into Scotland upon affairs connected with his
lands, and was prompted by duty and conscience ‘to lay
homage at the feet of her who is, and ever must be, the
Cynosure of his obedient eyes.’ There was much about
merit, the Phœnix, the surcharged heart of a father, ties
of blood—common properties of such letters; and the
unequivocal suggestion that favour would meet favour
half-way.</p>

<p>These documents were vastly agreeable to the Italian.
They invited him to be benevolent and lose nothing by it.</p>

<p>One of these honourable persons desired to ruin the
bride, the other to prosper the bridegroom. Well and good.
And he, Signior David? What was his desire? To prosper
alike with bride, bridegroom, and the exalted pair, his
correspondents. <i>Va bene, va bene.</i> His business was therefore
simple. He must engage the bride to contract herself—but
with enthusiasm; for without that she would never
budge. And how should that be done? Plainly, by the
way of disgust. She must be disgusted with amours before
she could be enamoured of marriage. And how? And
how? Ha! there was Monsieur de Châtelard.</p>

<p>In some such chop-logic fashion his mind went to work:
I do not pretend to report his words.</p>

<p>He lost no time in accosting Mr. Secretary, on an early
day after his return to Saint Andrews, with his master-word
of ‘Kirk and Realm.’ The Secretary had not much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
taste for Signior David. ‘I see that you have a key to my
lips,’ he said. ‘You may rifle by leave, if you will let the
householder know just what you are taking out of his
cupboard.’</p>

<p>‘Eh, dear sir,’ cried the other, ‘how you reprove me
beforehand! Your cupboard is safe for me. I wish to
know how I can serve Milord of Moray; no more.’</p>

<p>The Secretary narrowed his eyes and whistled a little
tune. ‘You can serve him very simply. You write our
mistress’s letters? Now, the pen is in touch with the
heart. There flows a tide through the pen; but after a
flowing tide comes the ebb. The ebb, the ebb, Signior
Davy!’</p>

<p>‘True, dear sir——’</p>

<p>‘Why, then, consider the wonders of the pen! It forms
loving words, maybe, to the Queen our good sister, to the
Most Christian King our brother-in-law, to our uncle the
Cardinal, to our cousin Guise, to our loving cousin Henry
Darnley; and by the very love it imparts, by tender stroke
upon stroke, the ebb, Signior Davy, carries tenderness
back; in smaller waves,’tis true, but oh, Signior Davy,
they reach the heart! And how widely they spread out!
To suffuse the great sea! Is it not so?’</p>

<p>‘The image is ingenious and poetical,’ said the Italian.
‘I confess that I have a feeling for poetry. I am a
musician.’</p>

<p>The Secretary put a hand upon his shoulder. ‘Set my
words to music, my man. You shall hear them sung at a
marriage door. All Scotland shall sing them.’</p>

<p>‘Do you think Monsieur de Moray will sing them?’</p>

<p>The Secretary touched his mouth. ‘Our present
music,’ he said, ‘should be chamber-music, not brayed
from the housetops out of brass. But I am no musician.
Let us talk of other things. I have May in my mood, do
you know. This day, Signior David, May hath shone
upon December. Do you see a chaplet on my silver
pow?’</p>

<p>‘Ah! La Fiamminga has been kind?’ asked the Italian,
knowing with whom he had to deal.</p>

<p>‘You are pleased to say so,’ said the Secretary. ‘Know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
then, my dear sir, since there are to be no secrets to keep
us apart, that I am a happy man. For, sitting with our
mistress upon that great needlework of theirs, I found a
certain fair lady very busy over a skewered heart. “Come
hither, Mr. Secretary,” saith our mistress, with that look
aslant which you know as well as I do, “Come hither,”
saith she, “and judge whether Fleming hath well tinct this
heart.” I overlooked the piece. “Oh, madam,” say I, “the
organ should be more gules: this tincture is false heraldry.
And the wound goes deeper.” My fair one, in a flutter,
curtsied and left the presence. Then saith our Queen,
with one pretty finger admonishing, “Fie, Mr. Secretary,
if you read so well now, before the letter is in your hand,
what will you do when you have it in your bosom to con
at your leisure?” I had no answer for her but the true
one, which was and shall ever be, “Why, then, madam, I
shall have it <i>by heart</i>, and your Majesty two lovers in the
room of one.” I put it fairly, I think; at least, she thanked
me. Now, am I a happy man, Master David, think you?
With the kindness of my prince and the heart of my
dear! Sir, sir, serve the Queen in this matter of the
young Lord of Darnley. He is in Scotland now; I believe
at Glasgow. But we expect him here, and——Oh, sir,
serve the Queen!’</p>

<p>The Italian, who was fatigued by a rhapsody which
did not at all interest him, wagged his hands about, up
and down, like a rope-dancer that paddles the air for his
balance.</p>

<p>‘<i>Va bene, va bene, va bene!</i>’ he cried fretfully.
‘Understood, my good sir. But will this serve the
Queen?’</p>

<p>‘If I did not think so,’ returned the Secretary—and
really believed this was the answer—‘if I did not think
so, would my Lord of Moray, should I, press it upon
you?’</p>

<p>Signior David shrugged—but you could not have seen
it. ‘What is this young man?’ he asked.</p>

<p>‘It is impossible that you know so little. He is of the
blood royal by the mother’s side. He is next in title to
this throne, and to the other after my mistress.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>The Italian waved all this away. ‘Understood!
Understood already! Do you think I am a dunce?
Why am I here, or why are you here, if I am dunce? I
ask you again, What is he? Is he a man? or is he a
minion—a half, a quarter man? Do you know, Mr.
Secretary, that he has got to serve Dame Venus? Do
you know that he may drown in the Honeypot? Pooh,
sir! I ask you, can he swim? He will need the faculty.
I could tell you, for example, of one lord——But no!
I will not.’ He hushed his voice to an awed whisper,
seeming to reason with himself: ‘Here, upon my conscience,
is a woman all clear flame, who has never yet—never yet—met
with a man. Here is a Cup of the spirit of honey
and wine. Who is going to set the match to kindle this
quick essence! Who is about to dare? Why, why, why,—all
your drabbled Scotland may go roaring out in such
a blaze! <i>Corpo di sangue e sanguinaccio!</i>’ His excitement
carried him far; but soon he was beaming upon
Lethington, reasonable again. ‘Let us change the figure,
and come down. Dame Venus is asleep as yet, but
uneasy in her sleep, stirring to the dawn. She dreams—ha!
And maids belated can dream, I assure you. Is
this young man a Man? Lo, now! There is my question
of you.’</p>

<p>Mr. Secretary was alarmed. His teeth showed, and his
eyes did not.</p>

<p>‘You go too near, you go too near.’</p>

<p>But the Italian was now calm.</p>

<p>‘My friend,’ he said, ‘I am not of your race—sniffing
about, nosing for ever, wondering if you dare venture. I
am at least a man in this, that I dare anything with my
mind.’</p>

<p>Mr. Secretary agreed with him. ‘I assure you, Signior
Davy,’ he said, ‘that my Lord of Darnley is a fine young
man.’</p>

<p>The Italian threw up his hands. ‘Eh—<i>allora!</i> All is
said, and I go to work. Sir, I salute you. <i>Addio.</i>’</p>

<p>And to work he went, in the manner already indicated:—‘To
draw the Queen into the net of this fine young
man but one thing is needful: she must run there for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
shelter. She is a quail at this hour, grouting at ease in
the dusty furrow. If we are to help this favoured fowler
we must send over her a kite.’</p>

<p>Alas for friendship! His kite of election was Monsieur
de Châtelard. It will not be denied that the poet did his
share; but there were two kites sent up. Sir James
Melvill came back from England.</p>

<p>Meantime it should be said that there was truth in the
report. The young Lord Darnley was actually in Scotland.
Some held that he was in Lord Seton’s house in
the Canongate, others that Glasgow had him. There was
some doubt; but all the Court knew of his presence, and
talked of little else. The Queen maintained her air of
tutored virgin, while Mary Livingstone openly thanked
God that Scotland owned a man in it at last. This
honest girl had worked herself into a fevered suspicion of
everything breeched at Court.</p>

<p class="tb">Sir James Melvill, when he sent up his name for an
audience, had to run the cross-fire of the maids’ anteroom
first. Few could bear the brunt better than he.</p>

<p>‘H’m, h’m, fair ladies, what am I to tell you? He’s a
likely lad enough for a valentine; for a kiss-and-blush,
jog-o’-my-knee, nobody’s-coming, pert jessamy. Oh, ay!
He can lead a dance more than a little—Pavane, Galliard,
what you will of the kind: advance a leg, turn a maid
about, require a little favour, and ken what to do wi’t.
He hath a seat for a horse, and a rough tongue for a
groom. Ay, ay! young Adonis ardent for the chase, he is;
and as smooth on the chin as a mistress.’</p>

<p>They laughed at him, while Master Adam of Gordon,
page at the door, rubbed his own sharp chin, and could
have sworn there was a hair. The usher came for Sir
James, and cut pretty Seton short in her clamour for more.</p>

<p>He found his mistress and the Italian in the cabinet,
their heads together over a chapter of <i>Machiavel</i>. He
knew the book well, and could have sworn to the look
of the close page. They sprang apart; at least Riccio
sprang; the Queen looked up at the wall and did not
face about for a while, but sat pondering the book, over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
which she had clasped her two hands. She was turning
a ring about and about, round and round; and it seemed
to Sir James, who saw most things, that this had been
upon the book while the two heads were bent over it.
They had been trying the <i>Sortes</i>, then!—the <i>Sors
Machiavelliana</i>, eh?</p>

<p>When, after a time of suspense, she turned, to lift him
a careless hand, limp to the touch and cold to kiss, he
knew that she had been schooling herself. She was
extremely composed—too much so, he judged; he had
no belief in her languid manner. She asked him a few
questions about her ‘good sister’; nothing of anybody
else. What did her sister think of the marriage? Sir
James lurked in the fastnesses of platitude. Her English
Majesty had deeply at heart this Queen’s welfare; he
turned it many ways, but always came back to that. As
he had been sure she would, after a little of it, Queen
Mary grew irritable, and drew out into the open. ‘Peace
to your empty professions, Master Melvill. They are little
to my liking. Did my sister send the Lord Darnley into
Scotland?’</p>

<p>Here he had it. ‘Madam,’ quoth Sir James, ‘I will
not affirm it. And yet I believe that she was glad for him
to go.’</p>

<p>‘Why so? why so?’</p>

<p>‘I nail my judgment, madam, to this solid beam of truth,
that my lord got his <i>congé</i> after but two refusals of it.’</p>

<p>‘Why should he be refused?’</p>

<p>‘Madam, for your Grace’s sake; because her English
Majesty thinks meanly of him beside yourself.’</p>

<p>‘He is of royal blood—but let that be as it may. If
he was first refused upon that account, why then was he
afterwards allowed?’</p>

<p>Sir James twinkled. I have said that he, as well as the
Italian, had a kite to send up, to drive this quail into the
net of marriage. He now had his opportunity to fly it.
‘Oh, madam,’ he replied, ‘this young Lord of Darnley was
not the only courtier anxious to travel the North road:
there was another, as your Majesty knows. And if the
English Queen let one go at the last it was in regard for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
the other. It was for fear lest you should win my Lord
Robert Dudley.’</p>

<p>The Queen grew red. ‘<i>Win? Win?</i> This is a strange
word to use, Mr. Legate. Am I hunting husbands, then?’</p>

<p>‘It is not my word, madam. I can assure your Majesty
that both the word and the suspicion are the English
Queen’s. It is thus she herself thinks of my Lord Robert—as
of a prize to be sought. But my Lord Darnley she
calls “that long lad.”’</p>

<p>‘He is my cousin, and her own. He shall be welcome
here when he comes—if he comes. But it mislikes me
greatly to suppose him sent out from England, a scapegoat
into the wilderness.’ She frowned, and bit her lip; she
looked haggard, rather cruel. ‘A scapegoat into the
wilderness! Robert Dudley’s scapegoat!’</p>

<p>You may cheapen a man by a phrase; but sometimes
the same phrase will cheapen you. Hateful thought to
her, that she was casting a net for Robert Dudley! And
not she only; there were two panting Queens after him;
and this high-descended Harry Stuart—a decoy to call one
off! Sir James, greatly tickled, was about to speak again;
his mouth was open already when he caught the Italian’s
wary eye. That said, ‘For Jesu’s sake no more, or you
spoil a fine shot.’ So Sir James held his peace. She sent
away the pair of them, and sat alone.</p>

<p>Something bitter had been stirred, which staled all her
hopes and made sour all her dreams. To ‘win’ Robert
Dudley! Oh, abhorred hunt, abhorred huntress! Quick
as thought came the counter query: Was it worse to hunt
one man than seek to be hunted by another—to seek it,
do you mind? to love the pursuit, ah, and to entreat it?
There came up a vision to flood her with shame—the old
vision of the laughing red mouth, the jutting beard, the
two ribald eyes. These were not a hunter’s, O God;
these cared not to move unless they were enticed! These
belonged to a man who waited, sure of himself and sure of
his comforts, while she (like a hen-sparrow) trailed her
wing to call him on. Panic seized her—her heart stood
still. What had she done, wanton decoy that she was?
And what had <i>he</i> done—with her glove? Where had he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
put it? Anywhere! Let it lie! Oh, but she must have
it again at all costs. She must send for it. Oh, unworthy
huntress, abhorred hunt!</p>

<p>She must have a new messenger. Adam Gordon must
ride into Edinburgh, show a ring to the Earl of Bothwell,
and ask for a packet of hers. He was not to speak of his
journey to a soul about the Court—on his life, not a word
to Des-Essars: he was not to return without the packet.
‘Go now, Adam, and haste, haste, haste!’ She lashed
herself ill over this melancholy business, and went to bed
early.</p>

<p>This was the night—when she had congealed herself
by remorse into the semblance of a nun—this was the night
of all in the year chosen by Monsieur de Châtelard for his
great second essay. Rather, the Italian sought him out and
urged him to it. ‘Hail, sublime adventurer!’ the kite-flyer
had cried, the moment he met with him.</p>

<p>‘I accept the title,’ replied Monsieur de Châtelard, ‘but
deprecate it as prematurely bestowed.’</p>

<p>‘Not so, my friend,’ says the Italian; ‘but if I know
anything of women, there may be this night a very pretty
mating—as of turtles in March. A word in your ear.
Her Majesty has retired. So early! cry you? Even so.
And why? Ah, but you shall ask me nothing more.
To-morrow I shall not even inquire how you do. Your
face will proclaim you.’</p>

<p>Monsieur de Châtelard embraced his friend. ‘Be sure
of my remembrance, immortal Italian.’</p>

<p>‘I am perfectly sure of it,’ answered Signior Davy; and
the moment after shrugged him out of his mind. This is
what your politician should always do: remember a friend
just so long as he is like to be useful.</p>

<p>He never had speech with him again. The miserable
young man, detected in a moment in filthy intention,
perhaps washed out the stain by a certain dignity of
carriage, whose difficulty alone may have made it noble.
This fool’s Queen—his peascod, melting beauty of a few
weeks since—was certainly a splendour to behold, though
the eyes that looked on her were dying eyes. A white
splendour of chastity, moon-chilled, sharp as a sleet-storm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
on a frozen moor,—she had burned him before—now she
struck ice into his very marrow. The caught thief,
knowing his fate, admired while he dared this Queen of
Snow and the North. For dare her he did.</p>

<p>‘What have you to say, twice a dog?’</p>

<p>‘Nothing, madam.’</p>

<p>‘Judge yourself. Lay your soiled hands upon yourself.’</p>

<p>‘Kill me, madam.’</p>

<p>‘Never! But you shall die.’</p>

<p>He died at the Market Cross after a fortnight’s preparation,
as he had not lived, a gentleman at last. For, by
some late access of grace which is hard to understand, she
accorded him the axe instead of the rope. He sent many
times for his friend the Italian, and at his latest hour, when
he knew he would not come, asked the headsman to present
him with his rosary. The headsman would not touch the
accursed idol.</p>

<p>‘If you touch me, you touch a thing far more accursed,’
said the condemned man, ‘to whom a death resembling
that of his Saviour’s companions in torment would be
infinite honour.’ He made his preparations, and said his
prayers. There were people at every window.</p>

<p>It had happened that my Lord of Darnley, with a fine
train of horsemen, having sent in his humble suit to the
Queen and received an answer, witnessed the ceremony:
or so they say. He divided attention with the departing
guest. All observed him, that he sat his horse well—easily,
with a light hand ever ready at the rein to get back the
fretful head. He watched every detail of the execution,
looking on as at a match of football among sweating
apprentices, with half-shut, sulky eyes. He spoke a few
words to his attendants.</p>

<p>‘Who is our man?’</p>

<p>‘They say a Frenchman, my lord. Chatler by name.’</p>

<p>‘To whom is he speaking, then? Watch his hand at
his heart. Now ’tis at his lips! He makes a bow,—will
they never finish with him? How are we to break through!
They should truss him.’</p>

<p>A young man behind him laughed; but my lord continued:
‘But—now look, look! Will he never have done?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
There are women at all the windows. See that French
hood up there.’</p>

<p>‘’Tis a woman’s business, my lord. They say that this
fellow——’ The young man whispered in his ear.</p>

<p>My lord made no sign, except to say, ‘My cousin is hard
upon a forward lover.’</p>

<p>‘Nay, sir. Say, rather, on a lover too backward.’</p>

<p>He got no answer from his prince. All looked, as there
fell on all a dead hush. The crowd thrilled and surged:
utter silence—then a heavy stroke—all the voices began
again together, swelling to one shrill cry. Châtelard, poor
kite, flew a loftier course.</p>

<p>The cavalcade began to drive through the maze of
people, pikemen going before with pikes not idle. ‘Room
for the prince! Room, rogues, room!’</p>

<span class="smaller">THEY LOOK AND LIKE</span></h3>

<p>He was rather stiff in the garden; rather too tall for the
raftered rooms of the burgess’ house. He did not lend
himself readily to the snug cheer which was the rule at
Saint Andrews. Des-Essars has recorded the fancy that
he was like that boy who comes home from school, and
straightens himself in his mother’s embrace; ‘not because
he loves her the less, but that he knows himself to be more
than when, six months ago, he parted from her with tears.’
This lordly youth cropped his English words, and stammered
and blushed when he tried the French. He laughed gaily
to hear the Italian <i>staccato</i> run its flight—like a finch that
dips and rises as he wings across the meadow. ‘Monkey-speech,’
my young lord called it.</p>

<p>In all respects he was on the threshold. None of the
deeper, inner speech of their daily commerce came near
him; he ignored, because he did not see, the little tricks
and chances, the colour, significance, allusiveness of it.
What was the poor youth to do? He had never journeyed
with the stored gallants of the <i>Heptameron</i>, nor whispered
to the ladies of Boccaccio’s glades. He thought Bradamante
a good name for a horse, and Margutte something
to eat. The Queen rallied him, the maids looked out of
window; Mr. Secretary exchanged glances with his Fleming,
Signior David bowed and bowed. But this Italian
was comfortable, seeing his ships homeward bound. In
rapid vernacular, as he lay late in his bed, he told himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
that the French poet could not have chosen a better night
for his extinguishing.</p>

<p>‘That was a night, one sees, when she suddenly sickened
of low company, having suddenly viewed it and been
shocked: of me, and the fat Bothwell, and all these cuddling
nymphs and boys. Our Châtelard was the last loathly
morsel, the surfeit after the Ambassador’s bolus. Certainly,
certainly! I saw her go white at his “winning” of the English
favourite: how a word may stick in a gizzard! Then comes
my late friend, hiding for favours under the bed. “<i>Dio
mio</i>,” she cries, “do I live in a lupanar? O Santo Padre,
let me henceforward mate only with eagles!”’</p>

<p>He expressed himself coarsely, being what he was; but
no doubt he was perfectly right.</p>

<p class="tb">My Lord of Darnley, then—this eagle—was a very handsome
youth, clean, buxom, and vividly prosperous. He
had the most beautiful slim body you ever saw on a young
man; and long legs, in whose shape he evidently—and
reasonably—took delight. He had that trick of standing
with his feet apart—grooms induce their horses to it with
the tickling of a whip—and arms akimbo, which, with its
blended savour of the Colossus of Rhodes and a French
dancer, gives a man the air of jaunty readiness for all
comers, and always a hint of gallantry. His head was
small and well set-on, his colour fresh; his eyes were bright
and roving. Yet no one could look more profoundly stupid
than he when he chose to be displeased with what was
saying. His lips were red, and like a woman’s; he had a
strong, straight nose, and strong hair, short and curling, in
colour a hot yellow. Good-natured he looked, and vain,
and courageous. Mary Seton considered him a dunce, but
Mary Beaton denied it. She said he was English.</p>

<p>The day of his coming, the Queen received him in the
Long Parlour, dressed mostly in white, with a little black
here and there. She stood about mid-floor, with her
women, pages, and gentlemen of the household, and tried
in vain to control her excitement. Those who knew her
best, either by opportunity or keen study, considered that
she had made up her mind already. This was a marriage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
this meeting of cousins: here in her white and faint rose,
shivering like the dawn on the brink of new day, with fixed
eyes and quick breath—here among her maidens stood the
bride. Appearances favoured the guess—which yet remained
a guess. She had travelled far and awfully; but
had told no one, spoken no whispers of her journeyings
since that day of shame and a burning face, when she had
sent Adam Gordon to Edinburgh Castle, heard Melvill’s
message, and scared away Châtelard to his dog’s death.
Not a soul knew where her soul had been, or whither it had
now flown for refuge: but two guessed, and one other had
an inkling—the judging Italian.</p>

<p>They used very little ceremony at Saint Andrews.
The Queen hated it. An usher at the stair’s foot called
up the Prince’s style, and could be heard plainly in the
parlour; yet Mr. Erskine, Captain of the Guard, repeated
it at the door. There followed the clatter of a few men-at-arms,
a trampling, one or two hasty voices—Lethington’s
whisper among them (he always shrilled his <i>s</i>‘s);
then the anxious face of the Secretary showed itself. The
young lord, dressed in white satin, with a white velvet
cloak on one shoulder, and the collar of SS round his neck,
stooped his head at the door, and went down stiffly on one
knee. Behind him, in the entry, you could count heads and
shoulders, see the hues of red, crimson, claret—feathers,
a beam of light on a steel breastplate. He had come well
squired. ‘Welcome, cousin,’ said the Queen shyly, in a
low and calling tone. My young lord rose; two steps
brought him before her. He knelt again, and would have
received her hand upon his own; but she looked down
brightly at his bent and golden head—looked down like
a considering bird; and then (it was a pretty act)—‘Welcome,
cousin Henry,’ she said again, and gave him both
her hands. He was afoot in a moment, and above her.
To meet his look downwards she must lift hers up. ‘Welcome,
cousin,’ once more; and then she offered him her
cheek. He kissed her, grew hot as fire, looked very
foolish, and dropped her hands as if they burnt him.</p>

<p>But he led her—she not unwilling—to her chair, and
sat beside her the moment she invited him. She was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
bashful at first, blushed freely and talked fast; he was
stiff, soldierly, blunt: when she was beyond him he made
no attempt to catch her up. Those bold eyes of his were
as blank as the windows of an empty house. They did
not at all disconcert her: on the contrary, she seemed to
see in his inertia the princely phlegm, and to take delight
in lowering the key of her speech to the droning formalities
of an audience. The difficulty of it, to her quick, well-charged
mind, was a spur to her whole being. You could
see her activities at drill; the more stupid she strove to be,
the more spiritual she showed. She took enormous pains
to set him at his ease, and so far succeeded that (though she
could not clarify his brains) she loosened his tongue and
eye-strings. He was soon at his favourite trick of looking
about him; passed all the maids in review, and preferred
Livingstone to any: next to her Seton—‘a pretty, soft
rogue.’ He saw and knew, but did not choose to recognise,
Lady Argyll.</p>

<p>Certain presentations followed. Englishmen were
brought up to kiss hands—tall, well-set-up, flaxen young
men: a Standen, a Curzon of Derbyshire, a Throckmorton,
nephew of an old acquaintance in France, a Gresham, etc.,
etc. After these came one Scot. ‘Madam, my kinsman
Douglas.’</p>

<p>There came stooping before her a certain Archie
Douglas of Whittinghame, remotely of the prince’s blood,
but more nearly of the red Chancellor Morton’s. He was
a young man, exceedingly thin, with a burnt red face,
shifty eyes, a smile, and grey hair which did not make
him look old. Black was his wear, with a plain white ruff.</p>

<p>‘I have heard of you, Master Douglas,’ says the Queen,
measuring her words. ‘You are a priest in Israel after the
order of Mr. Knox.’</p>

<p>‘An humble minister, madam, so please your Majesty.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, my <i>pleasure, sir</i>!’ She would not look at him
any more, either then or ever after. She used to call him
the Little Grey Wolf. Now, whether is it better for a man
to be spoken by his sovereign in discomfortable riddles,
than not at all? This was the question which Archie
Douglas put to himself many times the day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>The Queen would have honours nearly royal paid to
the young prince. The officers of the household, the
ladies, were all presented; and all must kiss his hand.
But all did not. Lord Lindsay did not; Mr. Erskine did
not, but saluted him stiffly and withdrew behind the
throne. Mr. Secretary did it; Lord Ruthven did it
elaborately; Lady Argyll changed her mind midway, and
did it. The Italian secretary, last of all, went down on
both his knees, and, looking him straight in the face, cried
out, ‘Salut, O mon prince!’ which, under the circumstances,
was too much. But the Queen was to be pleased
with everything that day, it seemed, for it delighted her.</p>

<p>As he went home to his lodging Signior David talked
to himself. ‘As well expect to weld butter and a knife,
or Madonna and a fish-headed god of Egypt as the Queen
with this absorbed self-lover. If she wed him not in a
month she will kill him sooner than take him.’</p>

<p>And Des-Essars records in his <i>Memoirs</i>: ‘The prince
pleased on horseback, whence he should never have
descended. I suspect that he knew that himself; for he
straddled his legs in the house as if to keep up the illusion
and strengthen himself by it. He was a fine rider. But
women are not mares.’</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Mary Livingstone had guessed, Des-Essars
had guessed, the truth or near it. This ceremony of meeting
was as good as a betrothal; though why it was so, was
not for them to understand. The explanation is to be
sought in the chasing, flying, starting life of the soul,
hunting (or being hunted) apart in its secret, shadowy
world. There come moments in that wild life when the
ardours of the chase slacken and tire; when, falling down
to rest, the soul catches sight of itself, as mirrored in still
water. That is the time when enchantment may go to
work to disenchant, and show the horrible reality. ‘What!’
might cry this girl’s soul: ‘this rumpled baggage a maid
royal! This highway-huntress, panting after one man or
the other, thrilling like a cook-wench because that man or
this has cast an eye on you! Oh, whither are fled the ensigns
of the great blood? Where hides the Right Divine?
Where are the emblems of Scotland, England, and France?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Not in these scratched hands, not behind these filmy eyes:
these are the signs of Myrrha and Pasiphaë, and sick
Phædra.’ Melvill had held up the glass, and she had seen
herself toiling after Robert Dudley; Châtelard had wiped
it, and behold her, trapped and netted, the game of any
saucy master. So, in a passion of amendment, she lent to
Harry Darnley all that she feared to have lost. He shared
the blood she had made common: let him re-endow her.
He was the prince she ought to have been. He came
a-courting with the rest; but as royal suitors come—solemnly,
with embassies, with treaties to be signed, and
trumpets to proclaim the high alliance. To think of Bothwell’s
beside this courtly wooing was an impossibility.
Hardy mercenary, to what had she dared stoop? To a
man—God forgive her!—who would hug a burgess-wife
one day, and her—‘the French widow,’ as he would call
her—the next. Ah, horrible! So horrible, so nearly her
fate, she could speak to no one of it. Simply, she dared
not think of it. She must hide it, bury it, and go about
her business by day. But at night, when Fleming was
asleep, she would lie staring into the dusk, her two hands
at grip in her bosom, and see shadows grow monstrous on
the wall: Bothwell and the wife of the High Street, and
herself—Dowager of France, Queen of Scots, heiress of England—at
play. She could have shrieked aloud, and whined
for mercy: she seemed to be padding, like a fox in a cage,
up and down, up and down, to find an issue. Harry Darnley
was the issue—O Ark of Salvation! Why, she had
known that the very night that Melvill came back. Afterwards,
as night succeeded night, and her eyes ached with
staring at the wall—she knew it was all the hope she had.</p>

<p>Then from her window, watching the shivering-out of
Châtelard, she had seen the prince, before his credentials
were presented—his beauty and strength and calm <i>manège</i>
of his horse. Had he been pock-marked, like Francis of
Alençon, his lineage would have enamelled him for her
eyes. But he was a most proper man, tall and slim, high-coloured,
disdainful of his company. He seemed not to
know that there was a world about him to be seen. <i>Securus
judicat</i>: Jesu-Maria! here was a tower of defence to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
smitten princess who saw all the world like a fever-dream!
Her own blood, her own name, age for age with her.</p>

<p>You see that she had her own vein of romantic poetry,
that she could make heroic scenes in her head, and play in
them, too, wonderful parts. She sat up in her bed one
night, and shook her loose hair back, and lifted up her
bare arms to the rafters. ‘My lord, I am not worthy.
Yet come, brother and spouse! We two upon the throne—Scotland
at our feet!’ Then, in the scene, he came to
her, stooping his stiff golden head. Jove himself came not
more royally into the Tower. She lay all Danaë to the
gold. Trickery here. Thus body lords it over soul, and
soul—the wretch—takes his hire. She knew pure ecstasy
that night; for this was a mating of eagles, you must
recollect. She bathed in fire, but it was clean flame.
Bothwell, at any rate, seemed burnt out—him and his
fierce arm, only one to spare for ‘the little French widow.’</p>

<p>So much explanation seems necessary of how she stood,
in virginal tremor and flying cloudy blushes, white and red
among her maids—to be chosen by her prince. She
intended him to choose: for she had chosen already.</p>

<p class="tb">The prince sat at supper, late in the evening of his
reception, with his light-haired Englishmen and grey-haired
Archie Douglas. Forrest, his chamber-boy, with burning
cheeks and eyes glassy with sleep, leaned at the door.
His little round head kept nodding even as he stood.
The young lord laughed and fed his greyhounds, which sat
up high on their lean haunches and intently watched his
fingers.</p>

<p>‘I shall take those horses of the Earl’s,’ he said. ‘I
shall need them now. I shall have a stud, and breed
great horses for my sons. See to it, Archie.’</p>

<p>‘By God, sir,’ said an Englishman, with hiccoughs,
‘your word may be the law and the prophets in this
country, and yet no bond in England. They will ask you
for sureties. Well! I say, Get your sureties first.’</p>

<p>My lord was not listening. He pulled a hound’s ear,
screwed it, and smiled as he screwed. Presently he
resumed. ‘Did you mark the greeting of Argyll’s wife,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
Archie Douglas? How she tried “Sir and my cousin,”
and thought better of it? I made her dip, hey? A black-browed,
saucy quean! What kindred to me are her
father’s misfortunes?’</p>

<p>Archie Douglas drained his glass. ‘You hold them,
Harry Darnley—the women. Yet remember you of what
I told you concerning the men. Steer wide of this’—he
caressed the jug—‘and fee the Italian.’</p>

<p>But my Lord Darnley got on to his feet, and remained
there by the aid of his fists on the board. Very red in the
face, and scowling, he talked with his eyes shut. ‘I shall
fee the Italian with the flat blade, you’ll see. Greasy
cushion of lard! A capon, a capon! And there’s your
red cousin Morton for you!’</p>

<p>‘He is your cousin too, sir,’ says Archie, blinking.</p>

<p>‘What of that, man, what of that? Let him beware
how he cozens me, I say. Boy, I go to bed. Good-night
to you, gentlemen.’</p>

<p>They all rose as he went solemnly away with the boy;
then looked at one another to see who had marked him
reach out for the door-jamb and pull himself through by it.
Archie Douglas crowed like a cock and flapped his arms;
but when the rest began to laugh he slammed the table.
‘Pass the jug, you fools. There shall be japes in Scotland
before long—but, by God, we’ll not laugh until we’re
through the wood!’</p>

<p class="tb">News of the Court for the rest of the month was this.
The Master of Sempill pled his own cause with the Queen,
and was to have Mary Livingstone. He had chosen his
time well; her Majesty was not for refusals just now.</p>

<p>‘My dear, my dear, I shall need women soon, not
maids,’ she had said, stroking the honest face. ‘You shall
come back to me when you are a wife, and as like as not
find me one too. Your Master is a brave gentleman. He
spoke up for you finely.’</p>

<p>‘Ay, madam, he hath a tongue of his own,’ says
Livingstone.</p>

<p>The Queen threw herself into her friend’s arms. ‘No
Madams to me, child, while we are in the pretty bonds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
together, fellow cage-birds, you and I. Come now, shall I
tell you a secret? Shall I?’</p>

<p>Livingstone, caught in those dear arms, would not look
into the witching eyes. ‘Your secret, my dear? What
can you tell me? Finely I know your secret.’</p>

<p>The Queen sat, and drew the great girl down to her
lap. ‘Listen—but listen! Last night the prince ...’:
and then some wonderful tale of ‘he’ and ‘him.’
‘Ruthven says that his ring of runes hath magic in it.
Some old wife, that hides at Duddingstone, and can only
be seen under the three-quarter moon by the Crags, she
hath charmed it. With that ring, rightly worn, she saith,
a man would swim the Solway at the flood after the boat
that held you. Ruthven knows the truth of it, and swears
that no man can resist the power it hath. There was a
case, which I will tell you some day. There is one stronger
yet—most infallible: a spell which you weave at dawn.
But for that there are certain things to be done—strange,
strange.’</p>

<p>‘No more of them,’ says Livingstone; ‘you have too
much charm of your own. What need of old bedeswomen
have you and your likes? Ah, yes, too much charm!
Tell me now, Marie; tell me the truth. Have you your
glove back?’</p>

<p>The Queen started violently, winced as if whipped in the
face and turned flame-red. Livingstone was off her lap:
both stood.</p>

<p>‘What do you speak of? How do you dare. Who has
betrayed——?’</p>

<p>‘Nobody. I saw that it was gone. And lately you
sent Adam to the Castle.’</p>

<p>The Queen walked away to the window, but presently
came back. ‘I think it right that you should understand
the very truth. That lord has angered me. Monstrous
presumption! for which, most rightly, he suffered. Believe
me, I saw to it. But—but—he has a conscience, I think.
Something was told me—made me suppose it. I considered—I
gave long thought to the case. A queen, in my
judgment, should not be harsh, for she needs friends. I
took a temperate method, therefore; considering that, if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
knew of my pain, perchance he would repent. So I sent
Adam Gordon to Edinburgh, and believe that I did well.’
She paused there, but getting no answer, asked impatiently,
‘Am I clear to you, Livingstone?’</p>

<p>‘You will never clear yourself that way,’ says Livingstone.
‘You could as well expect the Rock to thaw into
tears as get Bothwell to repent. That is a vile thief, that
man.’</p>

<p>The Queen ran forward and fell upon her bosom. ‘Oh,
I have been ashamed—ashamed—ashamed! The devil
was within me—touching, moving, stirring me. I thought
of him night and day. Wicked! I am very wicked. But
I have paid the price. It is all done with long ago. I told
Father Roche everything—everything, I promise you. He
absolved me the day before my prince came, or I should
never have received him as I did. And can you, Mary,
withhold from me what the Church allows?’</p>

<p>Livingstone was crying freely. ‘God knows, God knows,
I am none to deny thee, sweetheart!’ she murmured as she
kissed her.</p>

<p>Second absolution for Queen Mary.</p>

<p>The Court was to go to Callander House for the wedding
of this fond Livingstone; but before that there was a bad
moment to be endured—when Adam Gordon came back,
without the glove. They had told him in Edinburgh that
the Earl of Bothwell had broken bars and was away. He
had gone to his country, they said, and had been heard of
there, hunting with the Black Laird and others of his
friends—hunting men mostly, and Englishmen too, over
the border. He had sent word to George Gordon that, if
he was willing, he would ‘raise his lambs, and pull him out
of Dunbar for a bout with Hell’; but, said the boy,
‘Madam, my brother refused him.’</p>

<p>Adam had ridden into Liddesdale to find Bothwell, into
the Lammermuirs, into Clydesdale: but the Earl was in
none of his castles. Then he went the English road
towards Berwick: got news at Eyemouth. The Earl was
away. Two yawls had shipped him and his servants; had
stood for the south—for France, it was thought. The
glove was in his bosom, no doubt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>The Queen sent Adam away rewarded, and had in
Des-Essars. ‘Jean-Marie,’ she said, ‘my Lord Bothwell
hath gone oversea. Do you suppose, to France?’</p>

<p>‘No, madam; I suppose to Flanders.’</p>

<p>He seemed troubled to reply—evaded her looks.</p>

<p>‘Why there?’</p>

<p>‘Madam, there was a woman at Dunkirk——’</p>

<p>‘Enough, enough! Go, boy.’</p>

<p>She had appointed to ride that day to the hawking.
The prince was to be there, with new peregrines from
Zealand. Now—she would not go. Instead, she crept
into her oratory alone, and, having locked the doors, went
through secret rites. She stripped herself to the shift,
unbound her hair, took off shoes and stockings. With two
lit candles, one in either hand, she stood stock-still before
the crucifix for an hour. Chilled to the bones, with teeth
chattering and fingers too stiff to find the hooks for the
eyes, she dressed herself then in some fashion, and slipped
quietly out. This was her third absolution. Thus she
froze out of her heart the last filament of tainted flesh; and
then, bright-eyed and wholesome, set her face towards
the future.</p>

<h3 id="I_CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="smaller">PROTHALAMIUM: VENUS WINS FAIR ADONIS</span></h3>

<p>Mr. Thomas Randolph, Ambassador of England to the
Scottish Queen, told himself more than once that in seeking
the lady of his heart he did not swerve the breadth of a
hair from loyalty to the sovereign of his destinies. Yet he
found it necessary to protest his wisdom in the letters he
wrote to his patron, the Earl of Leicester. Mary Beaton
was the Nut-brown Maid of his ballatry. ‘I do assure
your lordship, better friend hath no man than this worthy
Mistress Beaton, who vows herself to me, by what sweet
rites you shall not ask me, the humble servant of your
lordship.’</p>

<p>All this as it might be: Mary Beaton used to smile
when twitted by her mates about the Englishman’s
formalised passion, and ask to be let alone.</p>

<p>‘He’s not for ever at the sonnets,’ she said; ‘we discourse
of England between bouts; and it may be I shall learn
something worth a rhyme or two.’</p>

<p>They played piquet, the new game, together, and each
used it as a vantage-ground. He could not keep his
desires, nor she her curiosity, out of the hands.</p>

<p>‘Is four cards good?’ he would ask her; and when she
looked (or he thought she looked) quizzingly at his frosted
hair: ‘Is one-and-forty good?’</p>

<p>Then she must laugh and shake her head: ‘One-and-forty’s
too many for me, sir.’</p>

<p>‘I’ve a terce to my Queen, mistress.’</p>

<p>But she crowed over that. ‘And I’ve a quint to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
knave, Mr. Randolph; and three kings I have in my
hand!’</p>

<p>She found out that they were not best pleased in England
at the turn of affairs in Fife.</p>

<p>‘My Queen, Mistress Beaton,’ said the enamoured
Randolph, ‘cannot view with comfort the unqueening of
a sister. Nay, but it is so. Your mistress courts the
young lord with too open a face. To sit like one forsworn
when he is away; or when he is present, to crouch at his
feet! To beg his gauntlet for a plaything—to fondle his
hunter’s whip! To be meek, to cast down the eyes; to
falter and breathe low, “At your will, my lord”! Thus
does not my Queen go to work.’</p>

<p>Mary Beaton looked wise. ‘Sir James Melvill hath
reported her manner of working, sir. We are well
advertised how she disports.’</p>

<p>‘I take your leave to say,’ replied the ambassador, ‘her
plan is at once more queenly and more satisfying. For
why? She charges men upon their obedience to love her.
And they do—and they do! No, no, I am troubled: I own
to it. If you find me backward, sweet Beaton, you shall
not be harsh. How or whence I am to get temper to bear
much longer with this toss-pot boy, I know not. He is
the subject of my Queen; he is—I say it stoutly—my own
subject in this realm. But what does he? How comports
himself? “Ha, Randolph, you are here yet?” This, as he
parades my Lord Ruthven before me, with a hand on his
shoulder, my faith! I tell you, a dangerous friend for the
young man. And one day it was thus, when we passed in
the tennis-court. “Stay, Randolph, my man”—his man!
“I had something for your ear; but it’s gone.” It’s gone,
saith he! Oh, mistress, this is unhappy work. He doth
not use the like at Greenwich, I promise you.’</p>

<p>‘He is not now at Greenwich,’ says Beaton. ‘He is
come back to his own.’</p>

<p>Mr. Randolph jumped about. ‘His own? Have at
you on that! How if his own receive him not? He may
prove a very fish-bone in some fine throats here. Well,
we shall see, we shall see. To-day or to-morrow comes
my Lord of Moray into the lists. The Black Knight, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
may call him. Then let the Green Knight look to himself—ho,
ho! We shall see some jousting then.’</p>

<p>Mary Beaton shuffled the cards.</p>

<p>These joustings occurred, not at Callander, where Livingstone
had been wedded to her Sempill and the Queen had
danced all the night after, but at Wemyss, in the midst of
a full court, kept and made splendid in the prince’s honour.
The place pleased its mistress in its young spring dress,
attuned itself with her thoughts and desires. Blue, white,
and green was all this world: a gentle, April sky; not
far off, the sea; white lambs in the pastures, and the trees
in the forest studded with golden buds. Wemyss had for
her an air of France, with its great winged house of stone,
its <i>tourelles</i>, balustrades, ordered avenues raying out from
the terrace, each tapering to a sunny point; its marble
nymphs and sea-gods with shells; its bowers, and the
music of lutes in hidden grass-walks, not too loud to quell
the music in her heart. It was a pity that the prince knew
so little of the tongue, or it had been pleasant to read with
him—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Filz de Venus, voz deux yeux despendez,</div>
<div class="verse">Et mes ecrits lisez et entendez,</div>
<div class="verse">Pour voir comment</div>
<div class="verse">D’un desloyal service me rendez:</div>
<div class="verse">Las, punissez-le, ou bien luy commandez</div>
<div class="verse">Vivre autrement—</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and see his fine blushes over the words. But although
he had never heard of Maître Clément, he was in love
without him, and could take an Englishman’s reasonable
pleasure in hearing himself called ‘Venus’ boy,’ or Rose-cheekt
Adonis.’</p>

<p>Certainly he must have been in love. He told Antony
Standen so every night over their cups; and little Forrest,
a pert child who slept (like a little dog) at the foot of his
great bed—he knew it too; for it had thrust a new duty
upon him and many stripes. All the Court knew that
when Forrest had red eyes the prince had overslept
himself.</p>

<p>It was the Queen’s romantic device: she was full of
them at this time. From her wing of the house you could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
see the prince’s; her bedchamber windows gave right
across the grass-plat to his. Now, at an early hour, she—who
woke still earlier, and lay long, thinking—stirred
Mary Fleming from her side by biting her shoulder, not
hard. Sleepy Fleming, when she had learned the rules,
slipped out of bed and pulled aside the curtains to let in
the day; then robed the Queen in a bedgown of blue,
with white fur, her furred slippers, and a hood. Armed
thus for the amorous fray, as Mr. Randolph put it—at any
rate, with shining eyes and auroral hues, Queen Mary went
to watch at the window; and so intent did she stand there,
looking out over the wet grass, that she heeded neither the
rooks drifting in the high wind, nor the guards of the door
who were spying at her, nor the guard by the privy-postern,
who beckoned to his fellow to come out of the
guard-house and witness what he saw. Not only was
she heedless, but she would have been indifferent had she
heeded.</p>

<p>After a time of motionless attention, this always occurred.
She raised her hand with a handkerchief in it, and signalled
once—then twice—then three times—then four times.
Then she dropped her hand and stood stone-still again;
and then Fleming came to take her away, if she would go.
The guards, greatly diverted, were some time before they
found out that the appearance of the prince at his window
was the thing signalised, and that he duly answered every
dip of the handkerchief. It was, in fact, a flag-language,
planned by the Queen soon after she came to Wemyss.
<i>One</i> meant, ‘Oh, happy day!’ <i>two</i>, ‘I am well.—And
you?’ <i>three</i>, ‘I love you’; <i>four</i>, ‘I would kiss you if I
were near’; and <i>five</i>, which was a later addition, and not
always given, ‘I am kissing you in my heart.’ To this
one was generally added a gesture of the knuckles to the
lips. Now, it was the business of young Forrest to
awaken his lord in time for this ceremony: obviously, her
Majesty could not be left to a solitary vigil for long. The
prince was a heavy sleeper, to bed late, and lamentably
unsober. Forrest, then, must needs suffer; for my lord
was furious when disturbed in his morning sleep. But the
lad found that he suffered more when, by a dire mischance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
one day he did not wake him at all. For that he was
beaten with a great stick; nor is it wonderful. There
had been wild work in the corridors the morn: maids half-dressed
with messages for men half-tipsy; and the Queen
in her chamber, sobbing in Mary Fleming’s arms.</p>

<p>I think that the young man is to be excused for believing
himself overweeningly loved. I think he was at first
flattered by the attention, and believed that he returned
ardour for ardour. But either he was cold by nature, or (as
the Italian held) assotted of himself: there is little doubt but
he soon tired of the lovers’ food. Clearer facts are these:
that he was not touched by the Queen’s generous surrender,
and did not see that it was generous. ‘You may say, if you
choose,’ writes he of <i>Le Secret des Secrets</i>, ‘that a vain man
is a gross feeder, to whom flattery is but a snack; but the
old half-truth takes me nearer, which says that every man
is dog or cat. If you stroke your dog, he adores the stooping
godhead in you. The cat sees you a fool for your
pains. So for every testimony of the submiss heart given
him by my lady, my lord added one cubit to his stature. I
myself, Jean-Marie Des-Essars, heard him speak of her to
my Lord Ruthven, and other friends of his, as “the fond
Queen.” Encouraged by their applause, he was tardy to
respond. He danced with her at her desire, and might not,
of course, ask her in return: that is, by strict custom. But
my mistress was no stickler for Court rules; and if he had
asked her I know she would have been moved. However,
he never did. He danced with Mary Seton when he
could; and as for Madame de Sempill, when she returned
after her marriage, if ever a young lord was at the mercy
of a young woman, that was his case. Handsome, black-eyed
lady! his knees were running water before her; but
she chose not to look at him. Failing her, therefore, he
sought lower for his pleasures; how much lower, it is not
convenient to declare.’</p>

<p>Mary Sempill resumed her duties in mid-April, having
been wedded at the end of March, and came to Wemyss
but a few days in advance of two great men—my Lord of
Moray, to wit, the Queen’s base-brother, and my Lord of
Morton, Chancellor and cousin of the prince. Before she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
saw her mistress, she was put into the state of affairs by
Mary Seton.</p>

<p>‘<i>Ma mye</i>,’ said that shrewd little beauty to her comrade,
‘in a good hour you come back, but a week syne had been
a better. She is fond, fond, fond! She is all melted with
love—just a phial of sweet liquor for his broth. I blame
Fleming; I’ve been at her night and morning—but a fine
work! The lass is as bad as the Queen, being handmaid
to her withered Lethington, so much clay for that dry-fingered
potter. But our mistress—oh, she goes too fast!
She is eating love up: there’ll be satiety, you shall see.
Our young princekin is so set up that he’ll lie back in his
chair and whistle for her before long—you’ll see, you’ll
see! If he were to whistle to-day she’d come running like
a spaniel dog, holding out her hands to him, saying, “Dear
my heart, pity me, not blame, that I am so slow!” Oh,
Livingstone, I am sore to see it! So high a head, lowered
to this flushing loon! Presumptuous, glorious boy! Now,
do you hear this. He raised his hand against Ruthven the
other Tuesday, a loose glove in it, to flack him on the
mouth. And so he handles all alike. ’Twas at the butts
they had words: there was our lady and Lindsay shot
against Beaton and him. Lindsay scored the main—every
man knew it; but the other makes an outcry, red in the
face, puffed like a cock-sparrow. Ruthven stands by scowling,
chattering to himself, “The Queen’s main, the Queen’s
main.” “You lie, Ruthven,” says the Young Fool (so we
all call him); and Ruthven, “That’s an ill word, my Lord
Darnley.” “You make it a worse when you say it in my
face,” cries he; “and I have a mind——” He has his glove
in his hand, swinging. “Have you a mind indeed?” says
black Ruthven; “’tis the first time I have heard it.”
Lindsay was listening, but not caring to look. I was by
Beaton—you never saw Lethington so scared: his eyebrows
in his hair! But we were all affrighted, save one: ’twas
the Queen stepped lightly between them. “Dear cousin,”
she says, “we two will shoot a main, and win it.” And to
Ruthven, “My Lord Ruthven,” says she, “you have done
too much for me to call down a cloud on this my spring-time.”
He melted, the bitten man, he melted, and bent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
over her hand. My young gentleman shot with her and
lost her the match—in such a rage that he had not a word
to say. Now I must tell you ...’; and then she gave
the history of the love-signals at the window.</p>

<p>Mary Sempill listened with sombre cheer. ‘I see that
it’s done. The bird’s in the net. Jesu Christ, why was I
not here—or Thyself?’</p>

<p>She did what she could that very night: divorced the
Master of Sempill and shared her mistress’s chamber. In
the morning there was a great to-do—a love-sick lady
coaxing her Livingstone, stroking her cheeks; but no flagwork
could be allowed.</p>

<p>‘No, no, my bonny queen, that is no sport for thee.
That is a wench’s trick.’</p>

<p>The truth was not to be denied; yet not Dido on her
pyre anguished more sharply than this burning queen.
And little good was done, more’s the pity: measures had
been taken too late. For she made humble access to her
prince afterwards and sued out a forgiveness, which to
have got easily would have distressed her. You may
compare wenches and queens as much as you will—it’s
not a surface affair: but the fact is, the heavier a crown
weighs upon a girl in love, the more thankfully will she
cast it to ground. Are you to be reminded that Queen
Mary was not the first generous lover in history? There
was Queen Venus before her.</p>

<p class="tb">My Lord of Moray, most respectable of men, rode
orderly from Edinburgh to Wemyss, with a train of some
thirty persons, six of whom were ministers of the Word.
He had not asked Mr. Knox to come along with him, for
the reason that the uncompromising prophet had lately
married a cousin of the Queen’s, a Stuart and very young
girl—fifteen years old, they say. Whether this was done,
as the light-minded averred, out of pique that her Majesty
would not be kind to him, or on some motion even less
agreeable to imagine—my Lord of Moray was hurt at the
levity of the deed, and suspected that the Queen would be
more than hurt. But I believe that she knew Mr. Knox
better than her base-brother did. However, failing Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
Knox, he had six divines behind him, men of great
acceptance. The Earl of Morton was waiting for him at
Burntisland: side by side the two weighty lords traversed
the woods of Fife. It might have been astonishing how
little they had to say to each other.</p>

<p>‘Likely we shall have wet before morn.’</p>

<p>‘Ay, belike,’ said the Earl of Moray.</p>

<p>‘These lands will be none the worse of it.’</p>

<p>‘So I believe.’</p>

<p>‘There was a French pink in the basin. Did your
lordship see her?’</p>

<p>‘Ay, I saw her.’</p>

<p>‘Ha! And they say there shall come a new ambassador
from the Pope.’</p>

<p>‘Is that so?’</p>

<p>‘By way of France, he must travel.’</p>

<p>‘Ay?’</p>

<p>‘Bothwell will be in France the now, I doubt.’</p>

<p>‘I’m thinking so, my lord, indeed,’ says the Earl of
Moray.</p>

<p>There was more, but not much more. A man tires of
picking at granite with a needle.</p>

<p>They reached Wemyss before nightfall; but already
torches were flaming here and there, and men running
made smoky comets of them, low-flying over the park.
The Queen was at supper in her closet; there would be
no dancing to-night, because her Majesty was tired with
hunting. ‘No doubt,’ said Lethington, ‘my Lord of
Moray would be received.’ Chambers were prepared for
both their lordships. Mr. Archibald Douglas would have
charge of his noble kinsman’s comfort, while by the
Queen’s desire he, Lethington, would wait upon my lord.
Bowing, and quickly turning about, the Secretary bent his
learned head as he announced these news.</p>

<p>Something, one knows not what, had invited urbanity
into the dark Earl of Moray. He was all for abnegation
in favour of the Chancellor.</p>

<p>‘See, Mr. Secretar,’ he said, ‘see to the Chancellor’s
bestowing, I beg of you. Lead my lord the Chancellor to
his lodging; trust me to myself the while. My lord will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
be weary from his journey—nay, my good lord, but I know
what a long road must bring upon a charged statesman:
grievous burden indeed! Pray, Mr. Secretar, my lord
the Chancellor!’ and the like.</p>

<p>‘Now, the devil fly away with black Jamie if I can
bottom him,’ muttered the Chancellor to himself as—burly
man—he stamped up the house. Mr. Archie Douglas, his
kinsman, at the top of the staircase, bowed his grey head
till his nose was pointing between his knees.</p>

<p>‘Man, Archie, ye’ll split yoursel’,’ says the Chancellor.
‘You may leave me, Mr. Secretar, to my wicked cousin,’
says he.</p>

<p>Lethington sped back to his master, and found him
still obstinately gracious.</p>

<p>‘Hurry not, Mr. Secretar, hurry not for me!’</p>

<p>‘Nay, my good lord, but my devotion is a jealous god.’</p>

<p>The Earl waved his hand about. ‘Ill work to pervert
the Scriptures and serve a quip,’ he said ruefully,—‘but
in this house!’</p>

<p>Mr. Secretary, knowing his Earl of Moray, said no
more, but led him in silence to the chambers, and silently
served him—that is, he stood by, alert and watchful, while
his people served him. The Earl’s condescension increased;
he was determined to please and be pleased. He talked
freely of Edinburgh, of the Assembly, of Mr. Knox’s
unhappy backsliding and of Mr. Wood’s stirring reminders.
Incidents of travel, too: he was concerned for some poor
foreign-looking thief whom he had seen on the gibbet at
Aberdour.</p>

<p>‘Justice, Mr. Secretar, Justice wears a woful face on a
blithe spring morning. And you may well think, as I did,
that upon yonder twisting wretch had once dropped the
waters of baptism. Man, there had been a hoping soul in
him once! Sad work on the bonny braeside; woful work
in the realm of a glad young queen!’</p>

<p>‘Woful indeed, my lord,’ said Mr. Secretary, ‘and woe
would she be to hear of it. But in these days—in these
days especially—we keep such miserable knowledge from
her. She strays, my lord, at this present, in a garden of
enchantment.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>‘And you do well, Mr. Secretar, you do well—if the
Queen my sister does well. There is the hinge of the
argument. What says my young friend Mr. Bonnar
to that?’</p>

<p>Mr. Bonnar, my lord’s chaplain, a lean, solemn young
man, was not immediately ready. The Earl replied for
him.</p>

<p>‘Mr. Bonnar will allow for the season, and Mr. Bonnar
will be wise. What saith the old poet?—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Ac neque jam stabulis gaudet pecus, aut aratror igni:</div>
<div class="verse">Nec prata canis albicant pruinis——</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Eh, man, how does he pursue? Eh, Mr. Bonnar, what
saith he next?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Jam Cytherea choros ducit Venus, imminente luna!’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>‘The moon is overhead, indeed, my lord,’ says the
Secretary, ‘and her glamour all about us.’</p>

<p>But his master jumped away, and was soon sighing.</p>

<p>‘There is always a grain of sadness in the cup for us
elders, Mr. Secretar; <i>amari aliquid</i>, alas! But I am
served.’ He was supping in his room. ‘Master Bonnar
will call down a blessing from on high.’ Master Bonnar
was now ready.</p>

<p>The game went on through the meal. Lethington
seemed to be standing on razors, the Earl not disapproving.
The great man ate sparingly, and drank cold water; but
his talk was incessant—of nothing at all—ever skirting
realities, leading his hearers on, then skipping away. Not
until the table was cleared and young Mr. Bonnar released
from his blinking duties was the Secretary also delivered
from torments. The scene shifted, the Earl suddenly
chilled, and Lethington knew his ground. They got to
work over letters from England, a new tone in which had
troubled the Secretary’s dreams. He expounded them—some
being in cypher—then summed up his difficulties.</p>

<p>‘It stands thus, my lord, as I take it. Here came over
to us this young prince from England, <i>with a free hand</i>.
We took what seemed fairly proffered; and why indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
should we be backward? We were as free to take him
as her English Majesty was free to send him. Oh, there
have been freedoms! I will not say we could have done
no better, in all ways. No matter! We opened our arms
to what came, as we thought, sped lovingly towards us.
Mr. Randolph himself could not deny that we had reason;
and I shall make bold to say that never did lady show
such kindness to a match, not of her own providing, as
our mistress showed to this. But now, my lord, now,
when the sun hath swelled the buds, there is a change in
the wind from England—a nip, a hint of malice. These
letters exhibit it, to my sense. I think Mr. Randolph
may be recalled: I am not sure, but I do think it. I know
that he desires it; I know that he suffers discomfort, that
he does not see his way. “Is this young man our subject
or yours?” he asketh. “Is he subject at all, or Regent
rather? And if Regent, whom is he to rule?” No, my
lord, Mr. Randolph, whether instructed or not, is itching
to be off. And that is pity, because he is bond-slave
of the Beaton, and would lavish all his counsel at her
feet if she desired him. Briefly, my lord, I jalouse the
despatch of Throckmorton to our Court, not upon a
friendly mission.’</p>

<p>The Earl listened, but moved not a muscle. He looked
like an image of old wax, when the pigment is all faded
out, and the wan smooth stuff presents no lines to be read.</p>

<p>‘You are right,’ he said presently: ‘Mr. Throckmorton
comes, but Mr. Randolph remains. The Queen
of England——’ He stopped.</p>

<p>‘She is against us, my lord? She grudges us the heir
of both crowns!’</p>

<p>‘I say not. She thinks him unworthy: but I must not
believe it, nor must you. Mr. Secretar, you shall go to
England. Presently—presently—we must be very patient.
Now of my sister, how doth she?’</p>

<p>‘The Queen dotes, my lord,’ said Lethington, and
angered the Earl, it seemed.</p>

<p>‘Shame, sir! Shame, Mr. Secretar! Fie! Queens must
not dote.’</p>

<p>It was characteristic of the relation between this pair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
that the master was always leading the man into admissions
and professing to be cut to the soul by them. But Mr.
Secretary had the habit of allowing for it. ‘I withdraw
the word, my lord. Maybe I know nothing. Who am I,
when all’s said, to judge?’</p>

<p>The Earl lowered his eyelids until they fluttered over
his eyes like two white moths. ‘How stand you with the
Fleming, Lethington? How stand you there? Can she
make no judge of you?’</p>

<p>It was the stroke too much. The stricken creature
flinched; and then something real came out of him. ‘Ah,
my good lord,’ he said, with dignity in arms for his secret
honour, ‘you shall please to consider me there as the suitor
of an honest lady, and very sensible of the privilege.’</p>

<p>Lord Moray opened his eyes, stood up and held out his
hands. ‘I ask your pardon, Mr. Secretar—freely I ask
it of you. Come—enough of weary business. Crave an
audience for me. I will go to the Queen.’</p>

<p>Mr. Secretary kissed his patron’s hand. ‘My prince
shall forgive his servant——’</p>

<p>‘Oh, man, say no more!’</p>

<p>‘——and accept his humble duty. I will carry your
lordship to the Queen. Will you first see the Italian?’</p>

<p>Quickly his lordship changed his face. ‘Why should
I see the Italian? What have I to do with him? Mr.
Secretar, Mr. Secretar, let every man do cheerfully his
own office, so shall the state thrive.’</p>

<p>He had the air of quoting Scripture.</p>

<p>The Queen saw her brother for a few moments, and he
in her what he desired to be sure of: eyes like dancing
water, and about her a glow such as the sun casts early on
a dewy glade. He had never known her so gentle, or so
without wit; nor had she ever before kissed him of her
own accord. Lady Argyll, his own sister, was with her,
the swarthy, handsome, large woman.</p>

<p>‘You are welcome, brother James,’ Queen Mary said;
‘and now we’ll all be happy together.’</p>

<p>‘I shall believe it, having it from your Majesty’s lips,’
said he.</p>

<p>She touched her lips, as if she were caressing what had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
been blessed to her. ‘I think my lips will never dare be
false.’</p>

<p>He said warmly, ‘There speaketh a queen in her own
right!’ What need had he to see the Italian?</p>

<p>Now, for the sake of contrast, look for one moment
upon that other great man, the Chancellor Morton, in his
privacy. Booted and spurred, he plumped himself down
in a chair, clapped his big hands to his thighs and stuck
out his elbows. He stared up open-mouthed at his kinsman
Archie, twinkling his eyes, all prepared to guffaw.
Humour was working through the heavy face. ‘Well,
man? Well, man? How is it with Cousin Adonis?’</p>

<p>Archie Douglas, scared at first, peered about him into
all corners of the room before he could meet the naughty
eyes. Catching them at last expectant, he made a grimace
and flipped finger and thumb in the air. ‘Adonis! Hoots!
a prancing pie!’</p>

<p>The Earl of Morton rubbed his hands together. ‘Plenty
of rope, man, Archie! Plenty of rope for the likes of
him!’</p>

<p class="tb">Des-Essars has a long piece concerning the official presentation
of the two earls to the prince, which seems to
have been done with as much state as the Scottish Court
could achieve.</p>

<p>‘My Lord of Darnley’s mistake,’ he says, ‘was to be
stiff with the wrong man. He was civil to the Chancellor,
his cousin—where a certain insolence would have been
salutary; he made him a French bow, and gave him his
hand afterwards, English fashion. But to my Lord of
Moray, a cruelly proud man, he chose to show the true
blood’s consciousness of the base; and in so doing, the hurt
he may have inflicted at the moment was as nothing to
what he laid up for himself. It was late in the day to
insist upon the Lord James’s bastardy. Yet——“Ah, my
Lord of Moray! Servant of your lordship, I protest.”
And then: “Standen, my gloves. I have the headache.”
He used scented gloves as a febrifuge. “A prancing pie!”
said Monsieur de Douglas in my hearing. Nevertheless,
my Lord of Moray spoke his oration; very fine, but marred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
by a too level, monotonous delivery—a blank wall of sound—to
which, for all that, one must needs listen. He was
not a personable man; for his jaw was too spare and his
mouth too tight. His flat brows, also, had that air of strain
which makes intercourse uncomfortable. But he was a
great man, and a deliberate man, and the most patient man
I ever knew or heard of, except Job the Patriarch. So he
spoke his oration, and left everybody as wise as they were
before.’</p>

<p>I myself suspect that the good Lord James was gaining
time to look round and consider what he should do. And
although he had scouted the notion that he could have
anything to say to the Italian, the fact is noteworthy that
to seek him out privately was one of the first things he did
with his time. Signior David told him frankly two things:
first, that if the Queen did not marry her prince soon she
would come to loathing the sight of him; secondly, he said
that if she did marry him the lords would get him murdered.
‘These two considerations,’ said Davy in effect, ‘really hang
together. The lords, your lordship’s colleagues, are not in
love with the young man, and so are quite ready to be at
him. But she at present is so, and in full cry. When she
slackens, and has time to open her eyes and see him as he
is——Hoo! let him then say his <i>Confiteor</i>!’</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that such perilous topics were
discussed with this brevity and point—certainly not where
the Earl of Moray was one of the discutants; this, however,
is the sum, confirmed to the Earl by what he observed
of the Court. There was no doubt but that the two things
did indeed hang together.</p>

<p>The Queen, his sister, as he saw very soon, did not go
half-heartedly to work in this marriage project. And the
louder grew the murmurs of Mr. Randolph, handing on
English threats, the more loyally she clung—not to her
prince, perhaps, but to what she had convinced herself her
prince was. He studied that young man minutely upon
every occasion, spent smiles and civilities upon him, received
rebuffs in return, and (with an air of saying ‘I like your
spirit’) came next day for more. He saw him hector
Signior Davy, tempt Lord Ruthven to <i>rabies</i>, run after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Mary Sempill, allow the Queen to run after him, get drunk.
He saw him ride with his hounds, break in a colt, thrash a
gentleman, kiss two women, lose money at a tennis match,
and draw his dagger on the Master of Lindsay who had
won it. A very little conversation with the Court circle,
and two words with his sister of Argyll, sufficed him.</p>

<p>‘Ill blood,’ said that stern lady. ‘The little bloat frog
will swell till he burst unless we prick him beforehand.
Not all Scots lords have your fortitude, brother James.’</p>

<p>‘Hush, sister, hush! I think better of poor Scotland
than you do. Who are we—unhappy pensioners—to
judge her Majesty’s choice?’</p>

<p>He walked away, being a most respectable man, lest his
fierce sister should lead him farther than it was convenient
to go; and after a week’s reflection sent Mr. Secretary
Lethington into England, with sealed letters for Mr. Cecil
and open letters for the Queen. In these he echoed English
sentiments, that the marriage was deplorable from every
view, to be opposed by every lover of peace and true religion.
He should do what could be done to serve her
English Majesty, being convinced that no better way of
serving his own Queen was open to him. The bearer was
in possession of his full mind; the Lord of Lethington
would convince his friends by lively testimonies, etc. etc.
This done, even then (so slow-dealing was he) he took
another week to deliberate before he selected his plan of
action and his hour. He could afford so much time, but
not much more.</p>

<p>It was an hour of a night when there was dancing and
mumchance: torches, musicians in the gallery, a mask of
satyrs, an ode of Mr. Buchanan’s declaimed, and some
French singing, in which Des-Essars eclipsed his former
self and won the spleen of Adam Gordon. For if her
Majesty had sent Adam into the Lothians and rewarded
him for it with a pat of the cheek, now she called the other
up to the daïs, publicly kissed him, and gave him a little
purse worked in roses by herself. There were broad pieces
in it too.</p>

<p>‘I shall pay you for that, Baptist my man; see you to
it,’ says Adam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>But Jean-Marie flourished his purse before he put it into
his bosom and hooked his doublet upon it. ‘Draw upon
me, Monsieur de Gordon, and let it be for blood if you
choose. I can well afford it.’</p>

<p>For the first time since her entry into Scotland the Queen
wore colours. She appeared in a broad-skirted, much-quilted,
tagged and spangled gown of yellow satin; netted
over with lace-work done in pearls. The bodice was long
and pointed, low in the neck; but a ruff edged with pearls
ran up from either shoulder, like two great petals, within
which her neck and feathered head were as the stamen of
the flower. It did not suit her to be so sumptuous, because
that involved stiffness; and she was too slim to carry the
gear, and too active, too supple and humoursome to be
anything but miserable in it. But she chose to shine that
night, so that she might honour her prince in her brother’s
cold eyes.</p>

<p>After supper, when there was general dancing, the Earl
of Moray surprised everybody by walking across the hall
to where Lord Darnley stood. A dozen or more heard his
exact words: ‘Come, my lord,’ he said, ‘I am spokesman
for us all; and here is my humble suit, that you will lead
the Queen in a measure. It would be her own choice, so
you cannot deny me. Come, I will lead you to her Majesty.’</p>

<p>He spoke more loudly but no less deliberately than
usual; there was quite a little commotion. Even the
young prince himself knew that this was an extraordinary
civility. One may add, perhaps, that even he received it
graciously. Bowing, blushing a little, he said: ‘My lord,
I shall always serve the Queen’s grace, and, I hope, content
her. I take it thankfully from your lordship that in this
yours is the common voice.’</p>

<p>The Earl took him by the hand up the hall. The Queen
had starry eyes when she saw them coming.</p>

<p>‘Madam,’ said her half-brother, ‘here I bring a partner
for your Majesty whom I am persuaded you will not refuse.
If you think him more backward than he should be and
myself more forward, you shall reflect, madam, that by
these means my zeal is enabled to join hands with his
modesty.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>‘We thank you, brother,’ replied the Queen, in a voice
scarcely audible. She was certainly touched, as she looked
up at her prince with quivering lips. But he laughed a
brave answer back, and held out his hand to take hers.
The musicians in the gallery, who had been primed beforehand,
struck into a galliard.</p>

<p>This dance is really a formal comedy, what we call a
ballet, with grave, high-handed turns to left and right,
curtseyings, bowings, retreats and pursuits. It quickens
or dies according to the air. You make your first stately
steps, you bow and separate; you dance apart, upon signal
you return. The theme of every galliard is Difference and
Reconciliation. It is a Roman thing, and has five airs to
it. The air chosen here was, ‘<i>Baisons-nous, ma belle</i>.’</p>

<p>The prince was a stilted dancer, Queen Mary the best
of her day—the exercise was a passion of hers. As for
him, he could never be any better, for, doubting his own
dignity, he was extremely jealous of it. It seemed to him
that to be limber would be to exhibit weakness. The
result of this disparity between the partners was, to the
spectators, that the Queen had the air of drawing him on,
of enticing him, of inspiring all this parade of tiffs and
sweet accord. It was she who, at the curtsey, showed
herself saucy and <i>maline</i>—she who, like a rustic beauty,
glanced and shook her head, hunched her white shoulder
and tossed his presence away. So it was she who came
tripping back, held off, invited pursuit, suffered capture,
melted suddenly to kindness. He regained her hand, as it
appeared, by right and without effort; she let it rest, they
thought, in thankful duty. It was make-believe, of course;
but she lived her part, and he did not. So blockish was
he that, Mary Seton said, the Queen seemed like a girl
hanging garlands round a garden god. All watched and
all passed judgment, but were prejudiced by the knowledge
that, as she danced, so she would choose to be. In the
midst, and unperceived, the Earl of Moray went out of the
hall, and sought the Italian in his writing cabinet.</p>

<p>Signior Davy was at work there by the light of a tallow
candle. His hair was disordered, his bonnet awry; he
had unfastened his doublet, and his shirt had overflowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
his breeches. He wrote fast, but like an artist, with his
head well away from his hand. It went now to one side,
now to another, as he estimated the shapes of his thin
lettering. ‘Eh! probiamo! Ma sì, ma sì—così va
meglio.’ So he chattered to himself at his happy
craft.</p>

<p>The Earl of Moray stepped quietly into the room and
closed the door behind him. The scribe lifted up his head
without ceasing to write. ‘Ah, Monsieur de Moray!
Qu’il soit le bienvenu!’ He finished the foliation of a
word, jumped up, snatched at his patron’s hand, briskly
kissed it, and said, ‘Commandi!’</p>

<p>They talked in French, in which the Earl was an exact,
if formal, practitioner. There was no fencing between
them. My lord did not affect to be shocked at hearing
what he desired to know, nor the Italian to mean what he
did not say.</p>

<p>‘I have been witness of great doings this night, Signior
David.’</p>

<p>‘The night is the time for doings, I consider,’ replied
the Italian.</p>

<p>This general reflection the Earl passed over for the
moment. ‘They dance the galliard in hall—the Queen
and the Prince. You can hear the rebecks from here.’</p>

<p>‘I know the tune, sir!’ cried Davy. ‘I set it. I scored
it for her long ago. It is <i>Baisons-nous, ma belle</i>. But
they murder it by clinging to the fall. It needs passion
if it is to breed passion. That music should hurt you.’</p>

<p>‘Passion is not wanting, Signior David,’ said my lord,
with narrowed, ever narrowing eyes. ‘And passion is
much. But opportunity is more.’</p>

<p>The Italian started. ‘You think it is a good hour?’</p>

<p>‘Judge you of the hour,’ said the Earl of Moray.</p>

<p>The Italian frowned, as he drummed with his fingers on
the table. He sang a little air: <i>Belle, qui tiens ma vie!</i>
My lord took a ring from his finger and laid it down: a
thin ring with a flat-cut single diamond in it, of great size
and water. Singing still, the Italian picked it up, looked
lazily at it. He embodied his criticism in his song—‘Non
c’è male, Signore! No-o-o-o-on c’è-è male!’ All at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
he clapped it down upon the desk and jumped round—fire-fraught,
quivering, a changed man.</p>

<p>‘You wish your opportunity—you think the hour is
struck! You observe—you judge—you make your plans—you
wait—you watch—and—ah! You come to me—you
say, Passion is not wanting, but opportunity is all.
And my music lends it: <i>Baisons-nous, ma belle</i>, hey?
Good, sir! good, sir! I thank you, and I meet you half-way.
In a little moment—ha! here is the moment.
Listen.’ A bell in the tower began to toll.</p>

<p>‘Midnight, sir!’ cried the Italian, leaping about and
waving his arms. ‘That is the midnight bell!’ He
struck a great pose—head thrown back, one hand in his
breast. ‘<i>Era già l’ ora che volge il disio!</i> Come, come,
my lord, we will put the point to the pyramid. Wait
for me.’</p>

<p>He ran out, cloaking head and shoulders as he went;
the Earl awaited him massively. In a little while he was
back again, cheerful, almost riotously cheerful, accompanied
by a blue-chinned young man, a priest of the old
religion, whose eyes looked beady with fright to see the
grim Protestant lord.</p>

<p>‘No, no, my reverend, have no fears at all,’ said the
Italian; ‘see nobody, hear nothing; but go to the chapel
and vest yourself for midnight mass. Quick, my dear,
quick!—off with you!’</p>

<p>My lord had contrived to freeze himself out of sight or
conscience of this part of the business. It was droll to see
how abstractedly he looked at the wall. The priest had
disappeared before the Italian touched his arm, beckoning
him to follow.</p>

<p>They descended from the turret upon the long corridor
which connected the two wings of the house; they went
down a little stair, and came to the Queen’s door, which
led from the hall to her own side. This door was closed,
but not locked. Pushing it gently open, Signior Davy
saw young Gordon looking at the crowd in the dusty hall,
his elbows on his knees. The hum and buzz of talk came
eddying up the stair—little cries, manly assurance, protestations,
and so on. ‘Hist, Monsieur de Gordon, hist!’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Adam looked up, Des-Essars peeped round the corner:
those two were never far apart.</p>

<p>The Italian whispered, ‘I must have a word with the
Queen as she comes up. It is serious. Warn her of it.’
Adam coloured up; he was flustered. It was Des-Essars
who, looking sharply at the incisive man, nodded his head.
Signior David drew back, and drew his companion back.
They waited at the head of the stair in the shadow, listening
to the rumours of the hall.</p>

<p>There came presently a lull in the talk, a hushing-down;
some sort of preparation, expectancy; they heard
the Queen say, quite clearly, ‘To-morrow, to-morrow I will
consider it. I cannot hear you now.’ A voice pleaded,
‘Ah, madam, in pity——!’ and hers again: ‘No, no, no!
Come, ladies.’</p>

<p>‘Room there, sirs! Give room there, my ladies!’ cried
the usher. Good-nights followed, laughing and confused
speech, shuffling of feet, and some rustling—kissing of
hands, no doubt. Then, as one knows what one cannot
see, they felt her coming.</p>

<p>Arthur Erskine, Captain of the Guard, marched up first,
solemnly, with two great torches; Bastien the valet, some
more servants. Margaret Carwood, bedchamber-woman,
appeared at the stair-head. Some of the maids of honour
passed up—Mary Beaton and a young French girl, hand-in-hand,
Mary Sempill, and others. Des-Essars stepped
from his place at the foot of the stairs and was no more
seen.</p>

<p>He was the next to reach the upper floor: Des-Essars
himself, white and tense. ‘She will speak to you here,’ he
told the Italian. ‘Show yourself to her.’</p>

<p>‘Altro!’ said Davy. Immediately after, they heard the
Queen coming.</p>

<p>She paused on the landing and looked about her. Then
she saw the Italian. ‘You wait for me, David? Go in,
<i>mes belles</i>,’ she said to Fleming and Seton, who were with
her; ‘and you too, Carwood. I am coming.’</p>

<p>They left her, and she stood alone, waiting, but not
beckoning. She looked very tired.</p>

<p>The Italian approached her on tiptoe, and began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
talk. He talked in whispers, with his hasty voice, with
his darting, inspired hands, with every nerve of his body.
She was startled at first—but he flooded her with words:
she had turned her face quickly towards him, with an
‘Oh! Oh!’ and then had looked as if she would run. But
he held out his imploring hands; he talked faster and
faster; he pointed to heaven, extended his arms, patted
his breast, jerked his head, sobbed, dashed away real tears.
She was trembling; he saw her trembling. He folded
arms over breast, flung them desperately apart, clasped his
hands, seemed to be praying. Godlike clemency seemed
to sit in him as he talked on; he looked at her with calm,
pitying, far-searching eyes. His words came more slowly,
as if he was now announcing the inevitable sum of his
frenzy. She considered, hanging her head; but when he
named her brother she started violently, could not control
her shaking-fit, nor bring herself to look into the shadow.
The Italian beckoned to his patron, who then came softly
forward out of the dark.</p>

<p>‘Dear madam, dear sister——’ he began; but she
stopped him by a look.</p>

<p>‘Brother, are you leading me?’</p>

<p>He denied it with an oath.</p>

<p>‘Brother,’ she said again, ‘I do think it.’</p>

<p>Then he changed, saying: ‘Why, then, sister, if I am, it
is whither your heart has cried to go.’</p>

<p>‘I believe that is the very truth,’ she owned, and looked
wistfully into his face. Signior Davy went downstairs.</p>

<p>She pleaded for a little time. She had not confessed for
five days—she was not ready—there should be more form
observed in the mating of princes—what was the English
use? In France—but this was not France.</p>

<p>He admitted everything. And yet, he said, the heart
was an instant lover, happiest in simplicity. A prince was
a prince from birth, before the solemn anointing. So a
bride might be a wife before the Queen had a Consort.</p>

<p>‘True,’ she said, ‘but a sovereign should consult his
subjects.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, sister,’ says he, ‘what woman could be denied her
heart’s choice?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>She hid her face. ‘God knoweth, God knoweth I do
well!’</p>

<p>‘Why, then, courage!’ said he. ‘Content your God,
madam, and follow conscience. It lies not in woman born
to do better.’</p>

<p>At this point the Italian came back, leading my lord.
The prince was flushed, as always at night, but sober, and
undoubtedly moved. He knelt before her Majesty unaffectedly,
bowing his head. ‘Oh, madam, my sovereign——’
he began to say; but then she gave a little
sharp cry, and took him up. Tenderly she looked at him,
searching his face.</p>

<p>‘Oh, I am here, my lord. Do you seek me?’</p>

<p>In return, after a moment’s regard of her beauty, he
choked a sob in his breath, shook his head and lifted it.</p>

<p>‘Now God judge me, if I seek thee not, my Mary!’</p>

<p>‘Come then,’ said the Queen—yet stood timorously still.</p>

<p>The Earl of Moray stepped forward with his arms uplifted.
His face was deadly white, but his eyes were fires.
‘Go in—go in——!’ he said with fierce breath, and
seemed to beat them before him into the open doorway.</p>

<p class="tb">When he had his royal pair safe in the chapel, the
candles lit and the priest at his secret prayers before the
altar<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>—then, and not before, did Signior Davy call in
the maids, Arthur Erskine, and Des-Essars. They came
trooping in together—nine, of them, all told—saw the lit
altar, the priest in yellow and white, the server, and those
two who knelt at the rail in their tumbled finery. Mary
Sempill gasped and would have cried out, Mary Seton
blinked her eyes, as if to give herself courage; but Davy
pointed awfully to the priest, who had made his introit and
opened the missal, and now stood rapt, with his hands
stuck out. If Arthur Erskine had moved, if Des-Essars
had started for the door, these fluttered women might
have——But Erskine stood like a stone Crusader, and
little Jean-Marie was saying his prayers. The Earl of
Moray was without the door, having refused to come in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus the deed was done. The Italian himself shut the
chamber door upon them and warned off the scared maids.</p>

<p>Outside that door, Adam Gordon and Des-Essars whispered
their quarrel out.</p>

<p>‘She gave me a ring when I came back from Liddesdale
and hunting Bothwell,’ says Adam.</p>

<p>‘Pooh, man: that she would have thrown to a groom.
Bastien has had the like. And what matters it now
whether she gave thee anything, or me anything? <i>Ah!</i>’</p>

<p>‘Let me hold that purse, Baptist, or I’ll scrag ye. ’Tis
my right.’</p>

<p>‘How your right, my fine sir?’</p>

<p>‘You swore that we should share her. The plan was
yours. You swore it on the cross. And you’ve held my
ring twice in your hands, and had it on your finger the
length of the Sentinel’s Walk. You disgrace yourself by
this avarice.’</p>

<p>‘You shall not hold my purse, Adam; but you may
feel it.’</p>

<p>‘Let me feel it, then. For how long?’</p>

<p>‘Till the bell goes the hour.’</p>

<p>‘That is only a minute or two.’</p>

<p>‘It will be ten minutes, I tell you. Now then, if you
care.’</p>

<p>Master Gordon put his hand into the bosom of Master
Des-Essars and solemnly pinched the purse.</p>

<p>‘She’ll be sleeping now,’ said Adam.</p>

<p>‘I doubt it,’ said Jean-Marie.</p>

<h3 id="I_CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="smaller">EPITHALAMIUM: END OF ALL MAIDS’ ADVENTURE</span></h3>

<p>He fell ill of measles, the young prince, before they
could leave Wemyss—measles followed by much weakness,
sweating, and ague; and though all her whispering
world—but the few—might wonder, nothing could keep
her from the proud uses of wifehood. She took her place
by his bed early—pale with care, yet composed—and kept
it till past midnight. It was beautiful to see her, with rank
and kingship cast aside, more dignified by her little private
fortune, more a queen for her enclosed realm. For now she
swayed a sick-room, and was absolute there: let seditious
murmurings and alarms toss their pikes beyond the border.</p>

<p>And indeed they did. Her secret marriage had been so
well kept, the Court fairly hummed with scandal; and the
simple truth was given a dog’s death that romantic tales
might thrive. It was commonly said that if she married
him now it would only be because shame would drive her.
The Earl of Morton went about with this clacking on his
tongue; plain men like Atholl and Herries looked all ways
for a pardon upon the doting Queen. In their company the
Earl of Moray lifted up deprecating hands; he agreed with
the Earl of Morton, advised Atholl and Herries to pray
without ceasing. The winds were blowing as he required
them; but this sickness was vexatious, with the delays it
brought. Time is of the essence of the contract, even if
that be only between a vainglorious youth and a rope.
Mr. Secretary wrote from England that the Queen of that
country was implacably against the marriage; it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
possible even now that it might be stopped. But it must
on no account be stopped.</p>

<p>This was, in early May, the plain view of the Earl of
Moray: that the thing must be publicly done, and soon
done, in order that his schemes should bear fruit. It is an
odd, almost inexplicable fact that he was to change his
whole mind in the course of a few weeks, and for no deeper
reason than a word lightly let fall by the Queen, his half-sister.
But what a word that was to the bastard of a king!
It was the word <i>King</i>.</p>

<p>There came to Wemyss, in the midst of these measles
and scandalous whisperings, a certain Murray of Tullibardine,
a friend of Bothwell’s—him and one Pringle.
They came together, and yet separately: Pringle with
griefs to be healed—that he, being a servant of my Lord
Bothwell’s, had been summarily dismissed with kicks on a
sensitive part; Tullibardine as a friend, frankly to sue his
friend’s pardon. My Lord Moray refused to help him,
having neither love nor use for a Bothwell, but he got to
the Queen by the back stairs and put his client’s case.
However, she scarcely listened to him. Busy as she was,
it was strange to see how far away from her ken the dread
Hepburn had drifted.</p>

<p>‘From the Earl of Bothwell—you? What has he to
report of himself—and by you?’</p>

<p>Tullibardine spoke of duty, forgiveness, the clemency of
the prince, while the Queen stirred the broth in her hand.</p>

<p>‘I never sent him to France,’ she said, ‘but to the Castle
of Edinburgh rather. He set me at nought when he fled
this country. Let him return to the place I put him in,
and we will think about duty, forgiveness, and the prince’s
clemency. I bear him no more ill-will than he has put in
me, and he can take it out when he pleases.’</p>

<p>‘I thank your Majesty,’ said Tullibardine, ‘and my
noble friend will thank you.’</p>

<p>‘He has only himself to thank, so far as I see,’ she
replied, and dismissed him before the broth could get cold.</p>

<p>Meantime the Earl of Moray had held a godly conversation
with afflicted Pringle. Pringle had much to say:
as that, of all men living, the Lord Bothwell hated two—his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
good lordship of Moray and Mr. Secretary. He had
sworn to be the death of each when he returned.</p>

<p>The Earl of Moray compressed his lips, straightened
himself, and cleared his throat.</p>

<p>‘I fear for him, Pringle,’ he said, ‘the wild, misgoverned,
glorious young man. I cannot charge myself with any
offence against him, and yet I remember that when I was
in France he girded at me more than once. But I am
accustomed in such variancy to hold my plain course.
Pringle, that was a desperate gentleman. He had to be
forbid the Court.’</p>

<p>‘True, my lord,’ says Pringle, ‘and your lordship knows
to what abominable usages he hath——’</p>

<p>‘Pray, Pringle, pray, no more!’</p>

<p>Pringle was now in the painful position of having staked
out a short road and finding it denied him. ‘I must
whisper in your lordship’s ear. I must make so bold.’</p>

<p>‘Man, I refuse you. Heinous living be far from me!’</p>

<p>‘My lord, I have heard the Lord Bothwell speak of the
Queen’s grace in a manner——’</p>

<p>‘Ay, it is like enough, poor Pringle. The wicked man
seeth wickedness all over.’</p>

<p>‘He spake of the Queen, my lord—in your ear——’</p>

<p>He breathed it low, a vile accusation concerning the
Cardinal of Lorraine and the Queen—his niece, and then
a girl of eighteen.</p>

<p>The Earl cowed him with a look. ‘Go, Pringle, go!
This talk should never have been held between us. You
have misused my charity. Go, I say.’</p>

<p>Pringle shivered out.</p>

<p>In his time the Earl of Moray saw the Queen, and, after
due preparation, chose to tarnish her ears with the tale.</p>

<p>But she was not at all tarnished. From her safe seat,
with but a party-wall between her husband and her, she
received it brightly.</p>

<p>‘Why, what a ragged tongue he hath! The poor, proud
Cardinal! Did he not love me? I believe he always
did.’</p>

<p>‘Madam,’ said her brother, ‘you interpret gently. This
makes the slanderer’s damnation the deeper.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>She laughed. ‘It is plain, brother, that you know little
of France. In France the truth goes for nothing, but the
jest is all. My Lord Bothwell has been much in France.’</p>

<p>‘A jest, madam? This a jest?’</p>

<p>‘It is quite in their manner. I remember the old
King——’ She broke off suddenly. ‘Oh, brother, my
King is more at ease! This morning his fever left him,
and there broke a great sweat.’</p>

<p>‘I rejoice,’ said he—‘I rejoice. But touching this
horrible railer—if he should crave leave to return——’</p>

<p>‘He has craved it already,’ replied the Queen. ‘I
answered that if he choose to come back to his prison
he may do it. But not otherwise. Brother, I must go
to the King.’</p>

<p class="tb">The King! We were there, then; and it galled him
like a rowel. Although she used it warily, and only with
the nine persons who were privy, he could not bear the
word; for every time he heard it he was stung into remembering
that he ought to have foreseen it and had not.
It is to be admitted that it had never once crossed his
mind—neither the word nor the thing; astute, large-minded,
wide-ranging as he was, he was also that unimaginative,
prim-thinking man who has pigeon-holes for
the categories, knows nothing of passion that breaks all
rules, nor can conceive how loyalty is like meat to women
in love, and humility like wine. Lethington could have
told him these things, the Italian could have told him, any
of the maids; and he never to have guessed at them!
Dangerously mortified at the discovery, his disgust with
himself and the fact worked together into one great distemper.
This it was which threw him out of his balance,
and led him presently to the greatest length he ever went;
but at present it was only gathering in him. It made him
doubtful, distrustful of himself and all; and when he looked
about for supports he could find none to his taste. One
folly after another! How he had cut away his friends!
There was Lethington in England. There was the Italian,
who knew so much. He sickened at the thought of that
capable ruffian who had helped him hasten the crowning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
of ‘the King.’ Very possibly—very certainly, it seemed
to him now, brooding over it in stillness and the dark—very
possibly the ruin of his life had been laid that night
when he had sought out the creature in his den and
bought him with a diamond. Argyll was here, Rothes,
Glencairn, and their like, and Morton the Chancellor,
whom he only half trusted. Besides, Morton was cousin
of this flagrant ‘King,’ and would rise as he rose. On the
whole, and for want of better, he consorted with Argyll
and his friends, and dared go so far as this, to tell them
that he had fears of the marriage.</p>

<p>‘I could have wished,’ he said to Argyll, ‘a livelier
sense of favours done in so young a man; also that my
sister might have judged more soberly how far to meet
him. If men of age and known probity had been
consulted!’</p>

<p>Glencairn, a passably honest man, and undoubtedly a
pious man, said tentatively here, that no lord of the
Council could be found to support the Prince. As for
the Queen’s grace——</p>

<p>‘She has been unhappily rash,’ says Moray; ‘I cannot
think more. Maidenly lengths would have become her, a
queenly regard, but surely no more.’ He turned to Argyll.
‘Frankly, brother-in-law, Mr. Knox should not hear of
these late doings—of these bedside ministrations, these
transports, these fits of self-communing, this paltering
with the tempter, this doffing of regalities. I pray, I
pray for Scotland!’</p>

<p>‘The gowk’s a papist,’ says Argyll, a plain man.</p>

<p>‘He is young, brother-in-law; that we remember
always.’</p>

<p>‘He stinks of pride,’ says Argyll,—‘sinful, lusty pride
of blood. If this marriage be made we shall all rue it.’</p>

<p>The Earl of Moray clapped a hand to each of his
shoulders.</p>

<p>‘Brother-in-law, pray for Scotland!’</p>

<p>‘Oh, ay,’ says Argyll, ‘and put an edge to my Andrew
Ferrara.’</p>

<p class="tb">How she lingered over him, prayed over him, watched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
every petulant twitching of his limbs, no one could know
altogether save Mary Sempill, and she had affairs of her
own to consider—a wife who knew she was going to be a
mother. But for this proud preoccupation, she might have
seen how touchingly the Queen made the most of her
treasure, and how all the ardour which had hurried her
into wedlock was now whipped up again to prove it bliss.
Was he fretful—and was he not? It was the fever in his
dear bones. Was he gross-mannered? Nay, but one must
be tender of young blood. Did he choose to have his Englishmen
about him, his Archie Douglas to tell him salt
tales, while she sat with her maids and waited? Well,
well, a man must have men with him now and again, and
is never the better husband for cosseting. When they
urged her to be a queen, she lowered her eyes and said
she was a wife. This raised an outcry.</p>

<p>‘He is, he can only be, your consort, madam.’</p>

<p>‘I am his, you mean,’ said she. ‘The man chooses the
woman. There are no crowns in the bridal bed, and none
in heaven. Naked go we to both.’</p>

<p>Mary Sempill wrung her hands over talk of the sort.
‘Out, alas! My foolish, fond, sweet lass!’</p>

<p>But Mary Fleming considered, nursing her cheek in the
way she had. ‘The strength of a man overrides all your
politics, my dear,’ she said gently. ‘The Salic Law is the
law of nature, I have heard men say.’</p>

<p>‘God smite this youth if he try it!’ said Sempill fiercely.
‘He’ll set the heather afire and burn us all in our beds.
And you, Fleming, will have need of mercy in your turn,
if you hearken to your grey-faced Lethington.’</p>

<p>‘Mr. Secretary has a very noble heart, Mary. I hope
I may say the same of your Master.’</p>

<p>Mary Sempill sniffed. ‘My Master, as you call him,
has a head for figures. He can cipher you two and two.
And he says of your Lethington that he is working mischief
in England.’</p>

<p>Mary Fleming rose with spirit to this challenge. ‘I
cannot believe it. You are angry with me because you
are vexed with the King.’</p>

<p>Then it was Mary Sempill to bounce away. ‘The King!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Never use that word to me, woman. There shall be no
King in Scotland till my mistress bears him.’</p>

<p>But she was talking without her book.</p>

<p>They moved to Stirling as soon as the young lord was
mended; and thither came the Earl of Lennox, in a high
taking—foxy, close-eyed, crop-bearded, fussy and foolish—to
pay his respects to the Prince his son. Never was a
more disastrous combination made: they cut the Court in
half, as shears a length of cloth. The garrulity of the old
man set everybody on edge; then came the insolent son,
to prove the truth even worse than they had feared. His
father egged him on to preposterous lengths, intolerable
behaviour; so the ‘pretty cockerel,’ as they called him in
France, made wild work in the hill-town. He quarrelled so
fiercely with my Lord Rothes that Davy had to pull him
off by main force, and then he drew his dagger on the Lord
Justice Clerk, who came to his lodging with a message from
the Queen.</p>

<p>‘Tell your mistress,’ he had cried out to that astonished
officer, ‘that I pay honour to none but the honourable.
You have come here with lies in your throat. She sent me
no such message. You are a very dirty fellow.’</p>

<p>Archie Douglas put in his oar. ‘No, no, sir. You
jest with the Lord Justice Clerk—but your jest is too
broad.’</p>

<p>‘By God, man,’ says the Prince, ‘this jest of mine is
narrow at the point. Let him come on and taste the forky
tongue of it.’</p>

<p>The Lord Justice Clerk was too flustered to be offended
at the moment; but when he had gained the calm of the
street he shuddered to recall the scene. Her Majesty must
be informed of every circumstance: flesh and blood could
not endure such affronts. It needed all her Majesty’s
cajolery to salve the wounded man, and more than she
had over to comfort herself when he had gone away
mollified.</p>

<p>Lord Ruthven was one of the Prince’s intimates at this
time, a malign influence; and the everlasting Italian was
another. Signior Davy, at home in all the chambers of
the house, used to sit on the edge of the young man’s bed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
and pare his nails while he talked philosophy and statecraft.
It was he who tempered the storm which had nearly
maddened the Lord Justice Clerk.</p>

<p>‘Your lordship is in a fair way to the haven,’ he said.
‘I tell you honestly you will get on no quicker for this
choler. You must needs be aware that her Majesty will
have no rest until you and she are publicly wedded. She
is fretting herself to strings under that desire. What then
is my advice to your lordship? Why, to sit very still, and
to insist with your respectable father that he hold his
tongue. I speak plainly; but it is to my friend and
patron.’</p>

<p>The Prince was not offended—but he was obstinate.</p>

<p>‘Speak as plain as you please, Davy, and deal for me as
warily as you can. The patent should be sealed.’</p>

<p>That was the root of the quarrel—his patent of creation
to be Duke of Rothesay. The Queen had promised it to
him, but there had been vexed debate over it in the
Council. It was a title for kings’ sons, and had always
been so. The Earl of Moray vehemently opposed; the
Argylls, Glencairns, and others of his friends followed him;
they had hopes also of the Chancellor. At the minute,
therefore, although the Queen had insisted even unto tears,
she had not been able to get her way. So she pretended
to give over the effort, meaning, of course, to work round
about for it. She had seen the Chancellor’s wavering: if
she could gain him she would have much. All she wanted
for herself was time, all from the Prince was patience. But
the furious fool had none to lend her.</p>

<p>When the Italian had done his work upon his nails—the
rough with the knife, the rounding-off with his teeth—he
resumed his spoken thoughts.</p>

<p>‘Your patent,’ he said, ‘is as good as sealed. The
Queen is at work upon it in ways which are past your lordship’s
finding out. For the love of mercy, be patient: you
little know what you are risking by this intemperance.
Why, with patience you will gain what no patent of her
Majesty’s can give you: that little matter of kingship,
which, in such a case as yours, goes only by proclamation
and——’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>My lord pricked up his ears to this royal word. ‘Ha!
In a good hour, Master David!’</p>

<p>‘Good enough, when it comes,’ says Davy; ‘but you
did not allow me to finish. Proclamation—and acclamation,
I was about to add; for one is as needed as the
other.’</p>

<p>This was a fidgety addition.</p>

<p>‘Pooh!’ cried the Prince, ‘the pack follows the horn.’</p>

<p>He set the Italian’s shoulders to work. ‘I advise you
not to count upon it, my lord. In this country there is no
pack of hounds, but a flock—many flocks—of sheep.
And they follow the shepherd, you must know. Therefore
you must be prudent; let me say, more prudent. The
Queen comes to you too much; you go to her too little.
It is she that pays the court, where it should be you. <i>Dio
mio!</i> It is not decent. It is madness.’</p>

<p>‘She is fond of me, Davy. The truth is, she is over-fond
of me.’</p>

<p>Signior Davy stopped himself just in time. He buried
his exclamation in a prodigious shrug.</p>

<p>The doings of the Lennoxes, father and son, which
scared the Court so finely, were the Earl of Moray’s only
hope. He, in truth, was very near finding himself in the
position of a man who should have lit a fire to keep wolves
from his door. The flames catch the eaves and burn his
house down: behold him without shelter, and the wolves
coming on! This is exactly his own case. Kingship for
the young man, by whose entangling he had hoped to
entangle his sister, was a noose round his own neck—the
mere threat of it was a noose. If he furthered it he was
ruined; if he opposed it—at this hour of the day—he
might equally be ruined. All his hope lay in England.
Let the Queen of England send for her runaway subjects,
and then—why, he could begin again. As day succeeded
to day, and favour to favour—the dukedom conferred, the
match in every one’s mouth, the Court at Edinburgh, the
Chapel Royal in fair view—he worked incessantly. He
dared not try the Italian again, lest the impudent dog
should grin in his face; but he secured Argyll and his
friends, the Duke of Châtelherault and his; he wrote to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
Lethington, to Mr. Cecil, to the Earl of Leicester, to
Queen Elizabeth. And so it befel that, one certain morning,
English Mr. Randolph faced the Lennoxes with his
mistress’s clear commands. Father and son were to return
to England, or——</p>

<p><i>Quos ego</i>—in fact; much too late for the fair. They
took the uncompromising message each after his kind:
Lennox, white-haired, ape-faced and fussy, sitting in his
deep leather chair, rolling his palms over the knobs of it,
swinging his feet free of the ground; the Prince his son
stiff as a rod, standing, with one hand to his padded hip—blockish
and surly as a rogue mule.</p>

<p>Lennox spoke first. ‘Hey, Master Randolph!’—his
little naked eyes were like pin-pricks—‘Hey, Master
Randolph, I dare not do it. No, no. It’s not in the power
of man living to do the like of it.’</p>

<p>Randolph shifted his scrutiny. The Prince was angry,
therefore bold; assured, therefore haughty.</p>

<p>‘And I, Randolph,’ he said, ‘tell you fairly that go I
will not.’</p>

<p>Randolph became dry. ‘I hope my lord, for a better
answer to the Queen your sovereign. Will and Shall are
bad travelling companions for a legate. I urge once more
your duty upon you.’</p>

<p>‘Duty!’ cried the flushed youth: ‘I own to no duty but
Queen Mary’s, and I never will. As to the other Queen,
your mistress, who grudges me my fortune, it is no wonder
that she needs me. You will understand wherefore in a
few days’ time. I do not intend to return: there is your
answer. I am very well where I am, and likely to be
better yet anon. So I purpose to remain. There is your
answer, which seems to me a good one.’</p>

<p>Randolph turned his back and left them. When he saw
the Earl of Moray he said that he had done his best to
serve him; and that, although he had no hope of staying
the marriage, his lordship might count upon the friendship
of England in all enterprises he might think well to engage
in ‘for the welfare of both realms.’ This was cold comfort.</p>

<p>Shortly after this disappointment the careworn lord got
into a wrangle with the Prince in a public place—not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
difficult thing to do. It began with the young man’s loud
rebuke of Mr. Knox, who (said he) had called him ‘a
covetous clawback,’ and whose ears he threatened to crop
with a pair of shears. Beginning in the vestibule of the
Council-chamber, it was continued on the open cawsey in
everybody’s hearing. There was heat; the younger may
have raised his hand against the elder, or he may not. The
Earl, at any rate, declared that he went in fear of his life.
Then came the hour, most memorable, when he saw the
Queen alone.</p>

<p>He was sent for, and he came, as he told her at once,
‘with his life in his hand.’</p>

<p>She asked him who would touch his hand, except to
take it and shake it?</p>

<p>‘One, madam,’ he replied darkly, ‘who is too near your
Majesty for my honour or——’ and there he stopped.</p>

<p>‘Or mine, would you say?’ she flashed back at him—one
of her penetrative flashes, following a quick turn of the
head. Remember, she knew nothing of his brawl with the
Prince.</p>

<p>He disregarded her <i>riposte</i>, and pursued his suspicions.
‘Madam, madam, I very well know—for I still have friends
in Scotland—in what danger I stand. I very well know
who talked together against me behind the back-gallery at
Perth, and can guess at what was said, and how this late
discreditable scene was laid——’</p>

<p>‘Oh, you guess this, brother! you guess that!’ the
Queen snapped at him; ‘I am weary of your guesses
against my friends. There was the Earl of Bothwell,
whom you guessed your mortal enemy; now I suppose it
is the Prince, my husband. Do you think all Scotland
finds you in the way? It is easy for you to remove the
suspicion.’</p>

<p>His looks reproached her. ‘Did you send for me,
madam, to wound me?’</p>

<p>‘No, no. You have served me well. I am not unmindful.’
Her eyes grew gentle as she remembered
Wemyss and the hasty mysteries of the night—the hurry,
the whispered urgings, the wild-beating heart. She held
out her hand, shyly, as befitted recognition of a blushful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
service. ‘I can never quarrel with you, brother, knowing
what you know, remembering what you have seen.’</p>

<p>Whither was fled the finer sense of the man? He misunderstood
her grossly, believing that she feared his
knowledge. He did not take her proffered hand—she
drew it back after a while, slowly.</p>

<p>‘You say well, sister,’ he answered, with cold reserve.
‘There should be no quarrel, nor need there be, while you
remember me—and yourself.’</p>

<p>‘It was not at all in my mind, I assure you,’ she told
him, with an air of dismissing the foolish thing; and went
on, in the same breath, to speak of the vexatious news
from England—as if he and she were of the same opinion
about that! Her ‘good sister,’ she said, was holding
strange language, requiring the return of ‘subjects in
contumacy,’ showing herself offended at unfriendly dealing,
and what not—letters, said Queen Mary, which required
speedy answer, and could have but one answer. The
Contract of Matrimony, in short, had been prepared by my
Lord Morton, was ready to be signed; the high parties
were more than ready. Should she send for the treaty?
She wished her brother to see it. That was why she had
summoned him.</p>

<p>He was seldom at a loss, for when direction failed him
he had a store of phrases ready to eke out the time. But
now that he was plumply face to face with what he had
come both to hate and to fear, he stammered and looked
all about.</p>

<p>She rang her hand-bell, and bade the page call Signior
Davy ‘and the parchment-writing’; then, while she waited
in matronly calm, sedately seated, hands in lap, he wrestled
with his alarms, suspicions, grievances, disgusts; saw them
flare before him like shapes—lewd, satyr shapes with their
tongues out; lost control of himself, and broke out.</p>

<p>‘The marriage-band, you speak of? Ah—ah—but
there is much to say anent such a thing—a tedious
inquiry! Madam—madam—I should have exhibited to
you before—the fault is in me that I did not——There
is a common sense abroad—no man can fight a nation—it
is thought that the case is altered. Yes, yes! Monarchs—you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
that be set in authority over men—are to be warned
by them that stand about your thrones, monished and
exhorted. ’Tis your duty to listen, theirs to impart:
duty to God and the conscience. I am sore at a loss for
words——’</p>

<p>Probably she had not been listening very closely, or
heeding his agitation. She stopped him with a little
short laugh.</p>

<p>‘Nay, ’tis not words you lack. Find courage, brother.’</p>

<p>‘Why, madam,’ said he, ‘and so I must. “It is expedient,”
saith the Book, “that one man die——”! What
a whole nation dreads, there must be some one to declare—even
though, in so doing, he should seem to stultify
himself. Oh, madam, is not the case altered from what
it promised at first? Alas, what hope can we now have—seeing
what we have seen—that this young man will
prove a setter-forth of Christ’s religion? Or how can we
suppose that he will ensue what we most desire—I mean
the peace of God upon true believers? Do they know
him in England and suppose that of him? Then how
can we suppose it? Why, what token hath he showed
towards the faithful but that of rancour? What professions
hath he made, save them of mass-mongering,
false prophecy, idolatry, loving darkness, shunning the
light? Oh, madam, I am sore to say these things——’</p>

<p>The Italian entered with his parchments before he could
hurry to a close or she stop him with an outcry.</p>

<p>It needed not so quick an eye to sense the brewing of
a storm. The Queen sat back in her chair, cowering in
the depths of it. Her eyes were fastened upon a little
glass bowl which stood on the table—in a broody stare
which saw nothing but midnight. The Earl, white to the
edge of his lips, was waving his hands in the air. Bright
and confident, the Italian stood at the door; but my
lord, in his agitation, turned upon him. ‘Man, you’re a
trespasser. Off with you! The Queen is in council—off!’</p>

<p>‘<i>Scusì</i>,’ says Davy, ‘I am summoned. <i>Eccomi.</i>’</p>

<p>He was dramatically quiet; he woke the Queen.</p>

<p>She started from her chair and ran to him. ‘Oh,
David, David, he denies me! Perjury! Perjury!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Sovereign lady,’ said the Italian, ‘here is one who will
never deny you anything.’</p>

<p>As he knelt my lord recovered his dignity. ‘It is not
convenient, madam——’</p>

<p>Ah, but she faced about. ‘Convenient! convenient!
To end what you have begun? You! that led me to
him! You that drove us in with your breath like a sheet
of flame!’</p>

<p>He put up his hand, driven to defend himself. ‘Nay,
madam, nay! It cannot be said. My design was never
adopted—it was misunderstood. I bowed to no idols—that
be far from me. I was outside the door. I neither
know what was done within your chapel, nor afterwards
within any chambers of the house. My only office
was——’</p>

<p>She held herself by the throat—all gathered together,
as if she would spring at him.</p>

<p>Signior Davy looked mildly from one to the other.
‘<i>Scusì</i>,’ he said, his voice soft as milk, ‘but your lordship
was not outside <i>all</i> doors. I know to a point how much
your lordship knows.’</p>

<p>The Earl gasped for breath.</p>

<p>At this point the Queen seemed to have got strength
through the hands. She let them down from her neck, as
if the spasm had passed. Her heart spoke—a lyric cry.
‘He brought me to the chamber door, and kissed my
cheek, and wished me joy!’ She spoke like one enrapt,
a disembodied sprite, as if the soul could have seen the
body in act, and now rehearse the tale. ‘He led me to
the chamber door, and kissed my cheek! “Sweet night,”
says he, “sweet sister! See how your dreams come true.”
And “Burning cheek!” says he; and “Fie, fie, the wild
blood of a lass!” I think my cheek did prophesy, and
burn for the shame to come.’ She turned them a tragic
shape—drawn mouth, great eyes, expository hands.
‘Why, sirs, if a groom trick a poor wench and deny her
her lines, you put her up in a sheet, and freeze the vice
out of her with your prying eyes! Get you a white sheet
for Queen Mary and stare the devil out of her! Go you:
why do you wait? Ah, pardon, I had forgot!’ She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
exhibited one to the other. ‘This man has no time to
spare that he may chastise the naughty. The throned is
made shameful that the throne may be emptied. Give
him a leg, David; he will stand your friend for it.’</p>

<p>‘Dear madam! sweet madam!’ murmured the Italian.</p>

<p>But she had left him now for the white skulker by the door.
‘Oh you, you, you, in your hurry!’ she mocked him, ‘deny
me not my shroud and candle. For if you are to sit in my
seat I will stand at the kirk gate and cry into all hearts that
go by, “See me here as I stand in my shroud. I am the
threshold he trod upon. He reached his degree o’er the
spoils of a girl.”’ She came closer to him, peering and
whispering. ‘And I will be nearer, my lord, whenas you
are dead. I will flit over the graves of the kings my
ancestors till I find the greenest, and there shall I sit o’
nights, chattering your tale to the men that be there with
their true-born about them. “Ho, you that were lawful
kings of Scotland, listen now to me!” I shall say. And
they will lift their heads in their vaults and lean upon
their bony elbows at ease and hear of your shameful birth
and life of lies and treasons, and most miserable death. And
you in your cerements will lie close, I think, my brother,
lest the very dead turn their backs on you.’</p>

<p>She stopped, struggling for breath. The dangerous
ecstasy held her still, like a <i>rigor</i>; but he, who with shut
eyes and fending arms had been avoiding, now lifted his
head.</p>

<p>‘You misjudge me—you are too hasty——’</p>

<p>As a woman remote from him and his affairs she
answered him, ‘Not so. But I have been too slow.’</p>

<p>‘Your Majesty should see——’</p>

<p>She sprang into vehemence, transfigured once more by
fierce and terrible beauty.</p>

<p>‘I do see. You are a liar. I see you through and
through, and the lies, like snakes, in your heart. I will
never willingly see you again.’</p>

<p>Still he tried to reason with her. ‘If accommodation
of joint griefs——’</p>

<p>‘None! There can be none. Where do we join, sir?
Tell me, and I will burn the part.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Dear sir,’ said the Italian, as she paced the room,
gathering more eloquence—‘dear sir, I advise you to
depart.’</p>

<p>The Earl was stung by the familiarity. ‘Be silent,
fellow. Madam, suffer me one more word.’</p>

<p>‘You drown in your words. Therefore, yes.’</p>

<p>He gathered his wits together for this poor opportunity.
‘I have been misjudged,’ he said, ‘and know very well to
whom I stand debtor for that. Nevertheless, I would still
serve your Grace in chamber and in hall, so far as my
conscience will suffer me. I say, that is my desire. But
if you drive me from you; if I am turned from my father’s
birthright——I beseech you to consider with what painful
knowledge I depart. If I have witnessed unprincely
dealing in high places——’</p>

<p>She openly scorned him. ‘Drown, sir, drown! No,
stay. I will throw you a plank.’</p>

<p>She rang the bell. Des-Essars answered. ‘If my lord
the Chancellor is in hall, or in the precincts in any part,
I desire his presence here. If he is abroad, send Mr.
Erskine—and with speed.’</p>

<p>The boy withdrew. She sat, staring at nothing. The
two men stood. Absolute silence.</p>

<p class="tb">The Chancellor happened to be by. He was found in
the tennis-court, calling the game. Much he pondered the
summons, and scratched in his red beard.</p>

<p>‘Who is with the Queen, laddie?’</p>

<p>He was told, the Italian and my Lord of Moray.
Making nothing of it, he whistled for his servant, who
lounged with others at the door.</p>

<p>‘Hurry, Jock Scott! my cloak, sword, and bonnet. At
what hour is the Council?’</p>

<p>‘My lord, at noon.’</p>

<p>He went off, muttering, ‘What’s in the wind just now?’
and as he went by the great entry saw the guard running,
and heard a shout: ‘Room for the Prince’s grace!’ He
could see the plumes of the riders and the press about
them. ‘It’ll be a new cry before long, I’m thinking,’ he
said to himself, and went upstairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>Entering that silent room, he bent his knee to the Queen.
She did not notice his reverence, but said at once: ‘My
Lord Chancellor, I shall not sit at the Council to-day.
You will direct the clerk to add a <i>postill</i><a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> to the name of
my Lord of Moray here.’</p>

<p>‘Madam, with good will. What shall his <i>postill</i> be?’</p>

<p>‘You shall write against his name, <i>Last time he sits</i>. I
know that your business is heavy. Farewell, my lords.’</p>

<p>Morton and Moray went out together. At the end of
the corridor and head of the stair, Morton stopped.</p>

<p>‘Man, my Lord of Moray, what is this?’</p>

<p>For answer, the Earl of Moray looked steadily at him
for a moment: then, ‘Come, come,’ he said, ‘we must go
to our work, you and I.’</p>

<p>They said no more; but went through the hall, and
heard the Prince’s ringing voice, high above all the others,
calling for ‘that black thief Ruthven.’ They saluted a
few and received many salutations. Lord John Stuart
passed them, his arm round the neck of his Spanish page,
and stared at his brother without greeting. These two
hated each other, as all the world knew. That same night
the Earl of Moray left Edinburgh, and went into Argyll,
where all his friends were. It was to be nine months
before he could lay his head down in his own house
again.</p>

<p class="tb">Very little passed between the Queen and her Secretary.
She sat quite still, staring and glooming; he moved about,
touching a thing here and there, like a house-servant who,
by habit, dusts the clean furniture. This brought him by
degrees close to her chair. Then he said quickly, ‘Madam,
let me speak.’</p>

<p>‘Ay, speak, David.’</p>

<p>‘Madam,’ he said, ‘this is not likely to be work for fair
ladies, though they be brave as they are fair. I have seen
it growing—this disturbance—a many days. He is not
alone by any means, my lord your brother. Madam, send
a messenger into France. Send your little Jean-Marie.’</p>

<p>She looked up. ‘Into France?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Madam, yes. Send a messenger into France. Let
him fetch home the Earl of Bothwell.’</p>

<p>She started. ‘Him?’</p>

<p>Riccio nodded his head quickly.</p>

<p>Whereupon she said, ‘He is not in France.’</p>

<p>‘Send for him, madam,’ said Riccio, ‘wheresoever he
may be—him and no other. Remember also—but no
hurry for that—that you have my Lord Gordon under
your hand. At need, remember him. A fine young man!
But the other! Oh, send quickly for him! Eh, eh, what
a captain against rebels!’ He could not see her face; her
hand covered it.</p>

<p>‘I will think of this,’ she said. ‘Go now. Send me
Carwood: I am mortally tired.’ Carwood was her bedchamber-woman.</p>

<p class="tb">There was a riot on the night following the proclamation
of King Henry, begun by some foaming fool in the
Luckenbooths. Men caught him with a candle in his
hand, burning straw against a shop door. ‘What are ye
for? What are ye for?’ they cried at him, and up he
jumped with the fired wisp in his hand, and laughed,
calling out, ‘I am the muckle devil! Come for the popish
King!’ The words fired more than the brand, for people
ran hither and thither carrying their fierce relish, feeding
each other. The howling and tussling of men and women
alike raged in and out of the wynds. It was noticed that
nearly all the women took the Queen’s part, and fought
against the men—a thing seldom seen in Edinburgh. In
a desultory way, with one or two bad outbreaks, of which
the worst was in the Grassmarket, where they stoned a
man and a girl to death, it lasted all night. The Lord
Lyon had his windows broken. Mr. Knox quelled the
infuriates of the High Street.</p>

<p>This was on the night of July 28th, very hot weather.
On the morning of the 30th she was married in her black
weeds—for so she chose it, saying that she had been married
already in colour, and as her lord was possessed of the
living, so now he should own the dead part of her. She
heard mass alone, for the Prince would not go to that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
again; but the Earl of Atholl stood by her, while Lennox
waited in the antechapel with his son. Mass over, the
words were spoken, rings put on. He had one and she
three. They knelt side by side and heard the prayers;
she bowed herself to the pavement, but he was very stiff.
They rose; he gave her a kiss. When her women came
about her he went away to her cabinet and waited for her
there, quiet and self-possessed, not answering any of his
father’s speeches.</p>

<p>Presently they bring him in the Queen, with coaxings
and entreaties.</p>

<p>‘Now, madam, now! Do off your blacks. Come, never
refuse us!’</p>

<p>She laughed and shook her head, looking sidelong at
her husband.</p>

<p>‘Yes, yes,’ they cry, ‘we will ask the King, madam,
since you are so perverse. Sir, give us leave.’</p>

<p>‘Ay, ay, ladies, unpin her,’ he says.</p>

<p>Mary Sempill cried, ‘Come, my ladies! Come, sirs!
Help her shed her weeds.’ She took out a shoulder-pin,
and the black shroud fell away from her bosom. Mary
Fleming let loose her arms; Mary Seton, kneeling, was
busy about her waist; Mary Beaton flacked off the great
hood. Atholl, Livingstone, Lennox, all came about her,
spoiling her of her old defences. When the black was all
slipped off, she stood displayed in figured ivory damask,
with a bashful, rosy, hopeful face. Atholl took a hand,
Lennox the other.</p>

<p>‘By your leave, sweet madam.’ They led her to the
young man.</p>

<p>‘She is yours, sir, by her own free will. God bless the
mating!’</p>

<p>Then, when they had all gone tumbling out of the
room, and you could have heard their laughter in the
passages, she stood before him with her hands clasped.
‘Yes, my lord, I am here. Use me well.’</p>

<p>He gave a toss of the head; laughed aloud as he took
her.</p>

<p>‘Ay, my Mary, I have thee now!’</p>

<p>He held her close, looking keenly into her hazel eyes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
He kissed her mouth and neck, held up his head, and
cheered like a hunter. ‘The mort o’ the deer! The mort
o’ the deer! ‘Ware hounds, ‘ware! Let the chief take
assay.’</p>

<p class="tb">The head of the Hamiltons, the head of the Campbells,
the head of the Leslies, were all in Argyll with the Earl of
Moray. Mr. Knox was with his young wife; Mr. Randolph
kept his lodging; the Earl of Bothwell was at sea, beating
up north; and my Lord Gordon, new released from prison,
was with his mother and handsome sister Jean. None of
these were at the marriage, nor bidden to the marriage
supper. But there came a decent man, Mr. George
Buchanan, affording himself an epithalamy, and received
in recompense the Queen’s and King’s picture set in
brilliants. This did not prevent him from casting up his
hands in private before Mr. Knox. The great elder
watched him grimly.</p>

<p>‘So the wilful lass has got her master! And a pranking
rider for a bitter jade! Man, George,’ he said, looking
critically through him, ‘in my opinion you are a thin,
truckling body.’</p>

<span class="smaller">OPINIONS OF FRENCH PARIS UPON SOME LATE EVENTS</span></h3>

<p>Nicholas the lacquey, whom they call ‘French Paris,’
can neither read nor write, nor cipher save with notches in
a wand; but he has travelled much, and in shrewd company;
and has seen things—whatever men may do—of
interest moral and otherwise. And whether he work his
sum by aid of his not over-orderly notches, or upon his
not over-scrupulous fingers, the dog can infer; he will get
the quotient just, and present it you in divers tongues,
with divers analogies drawn from his knowledge of affairs:
France, England, the Low Countries, Upper Italy, the
Debateable Land—from one, any, or all, French Paris can
pick his case in point. Therefore, his thoughts upon
events in Scotland, both those which led to his coming
thither in the train of my Lord Bothwell, his master, and
those which followed hard upon it, should be worth having,
if by means of a joke and a crown-piece one could get
at them.</p>

<p>You may see the man, if you will, lounging any afternoon
away with his fellows on the cawsey—by the Market
Cross, in the parvise of Saint Giles’s, by the big house at
the head of Peebles Wynd (‘late my Lord of Moray’s,’ he
will tell you with a wink), or, best of all, in the forecourt
of Holyrood—holding his master’s cloak upon his arm.
He is to be known at once by the clove carnation or sprig
of rosemary in his mouth, and by his way of looking
Scotchwomen in their faces with that mixture of impudence
and <i>naïveté</i> which his nation lends her sons.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
Being whose son he is, he will be a smooth-chinned, lithe
young man, passably vicious, and pale with it; grey in the
eye, dressed finely in a good shirt, good jacket and
breeches. But for certain these two last will not meet;
the snowy lawn will force itself between, and, like a vow
of continence, sunder two loves. Paris will be tender of
his waist. He will look at all women as they pass, not
with reverence (as if they were a holier kind of flesh), but
rather, like his namesake, as if he held the apple weighing
in his hand. Seems to have no eye for men—will tell
you, if you ask him of them, that there are none in Scotland
but his master and Mr. Knox; and yet can judge
them quicker than any one. It was he who said of the
King, having seen him but once, after supper, at Stirling:
‘This young man fuddles himself to brave out his failure.
He is frigid—wants a sex.’ And of the Queen, on the
same short acquaintance, but helped by hearsay: ‘She
had been so long the pet of women that she thought
herself safe with any man. But now she knows that it
takes more than a cod-piece to make a man. Trust Paris.’
Trust Paris! A crown will purchase the rogue, and yet
he has a kind of faithfulness. He will endure enormously
for his master’s sake, shun no fatigues, wince at no pain,
consider no shame—to be sure, he has none—blink at few
perils. Talk to him, having slipped in your crown, he will
be frank. He will tell you of his master.</p>

<p>A quick word of thanks, whistled off into the air, will
introduce him to the broad piece. He will give it a flick
in the air, catch it as it comes down, rattle it in his
hollowed palm, with a grin into your face. ‘This is the
upright servant, this pretty knave,’ he will say of his coin.
‘For, look you, sir, this white-faced, thin courtier is the
one in all the world whom you need not buy for more
than his value. God of Gods, if my master thought fully
of it he would be just such another. Because it is as plain
as a monk’s lullaby that, if you need not give more for
him than he is worth, you cannot give less!’</p>

<p>His master, you have been told, is the great Earl of
Bothwell, now Lord Admiral of Scotland, Lieutenant-General
of the East, West, and Middle Marches, and right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
hand of the Queen’s Majesty. How is the story of so high
a man involved in your crown-piece? Why, thus.</p>

<p>French Paris displays the coin. ‘Do you see these two
children’s faces, these sharp and tender chins, these slim
necks, these perching crowns? What says the circumscription?
<span class="smcap">Maria et Henricus D. G. Scotorum Regina
et Rex.</span> How! the mare before the sire? You have
touched, sir!’ For observe, Paris’ master came into Scotland,
a pardoned rebel, because this legend at first had run
<span class="smcap">Henricus et Maria Rex et Regina</span>, and there was
outcry raised, flat rebellion. And so surely, says Paris, as
he had come, and been received, him with his friends, and
had given that quick shake of the head (which so well
becomes him), and lifted his war-shout of ‘Hoo! hoo! A
Hepburn, hoo!’—so surely they struck a new coinage, at
this very Christmas past—and here we are over Candlemas—with
<span class="smcap">Maria et Henricus</span>, and the mare before the
sire. ‘That is how my master came back to Scotland, sir,
and here upon the face of your bounty you see the <i>prémices</i>.
But there will be a more abundant harvest, if I mistake
not the husbandman.’</p>

<p>‘That is a droll reflection for me,’ he will add, ‘who
have been with my master as near beggary as a swan in
the winter, and nearer to death than the Devil can have
understood. I have served him here and there for many
years—Flanders, Brabant, Gueldres, Picardy, Savoy, England.
Do you happen to know the port of Yarmouth?
They can drink in Yarmouth. I have hidden with him in
the hills of this country: that was when he had broken out
of prison in this town, and before he hanged Pringle with
his own hands. I have skulked there, I say, until the fog
rotted my bones. I have sailed the seas in roaring weather,
and upon my word, sir, have had experiences enough to
make the fortune of a preacher. There was a pirate of
Brill in our company, Oudekirk by name, who denied the
existence of God in a tempest, and perished by a thunderbolt.
Pam! It clove him. “There is no God!” cried he,
and with the last word there was a blare of white light, a
crackling, hissing, tearing noise, a crash; and when we
looked at Oudekirk one side of him was coal-black from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
the hair to the midriff, and his jaws clamped together! But
I could not tell you all—some is not very convenient, I
must allow.</p>

<p>‘We were at Lille when the Queen’s messenger—the
little smutty-eyed Brabanter—found us. He brought two
letters: the Queen’s very short, a stiff letter of recall, promising
pardon “as you behave yourself towards us.” The
other was from that large Italian, who sprawls where he
ought not, in his own tongue; as much as may be, like
this:—</p>

<p>‘“Most serene, cultivable lord, it is very certain that if
you come to this country you will be well received; the
more so, seeing that certain of your unfriends (he meant
Monsieur de Moray) have been treated lately as they well
deserve. The Queen weds Prince Henry Stuart, of whom
I will only write that I wish he were older and more
resembled your magnificence.”</p>

<p>‘All Italians lie, sir; yet so it is that their lies always
please you. You may be sure my master needed no more
encouragement to make his preparation of travel. It was
soon after this that he showed me a glove he had, and an
old letter of the Queen’s. We were in his bedchamber, he
in his bed. He has many such pledges, many and many,
but he was sure of this glove because it was stiff in two
fingers. When he told me that he intended for Scotland
and must take the glove with him, I said, “Master, be
careful what you are about. It is certain that the Queen
will know her own glove again, and should this prove the
wrong one it will be worse for you than not to show it
at all.”</p>

<p>‘“Pooh, man,” says he, “the glove is right enough.
There are no others stiff from a wetting. But look and
see. Let’s be sure.”</p>

<p>‘It was true there were no others quite so stiff in the
fingers. Tears had done it, the letter said: but who knows,
with women?’ French Paris, here, would give a hoist to
his breeches.</p>

<p>‘In September last we made land, after a chase in
furious weather. An English ship sighted us off Holy
Island: we ran near to be aground on that pious territory,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
but our Lady or Saint Denis, or a holy partnership between
them, saved us. They sent out a long boat to head us
into shoal water; we slipped in between. My master had
the helm and rammed it down with his heel; we came
about to the wind, we flew, with the water hissing along
the gunwale. We saw them in the breakers as we gained
the deeps. “There goes some beef into the pickle-tub!”
cried he, and stood up and hailed them with mockery.
“Sooner you than me, ye drowning swine!” he roars
against the tempest. Such a man is my master.</p>

<p>‘We found anchorage at Eyemouth, and pricked up the
coast-road to this place. The war—if you can call it war,
which was a chasing of rats in a rickyard—was as good as
over, but by no means the cause of war. The Queen was
home from the field, where they tell me she had shown the
most intrepid front of any of her company. Not much to
say, perhaps. Yet remember that she had Monsieur de
Huntly with her, that had been Gordon—a fine stark man,
like a hawk, whom she had set free from prison and restored
to his Earldom before the rebellion broke out; and
he is passably courageous. But it was a valet of his,
Forbes, “red Sandy Forbes,” they call him, who told me
that he had never in his life seen anything like the Queen
of Scots upon that hunting of outlaws. Think of this,
dear sir! The King in a gilt corslet, casque of feathers,
red cloak and all, greatly attended by his Englishmen—his
pavilion, his bed, his cooks and scullions; his pampered,
prying boys, his little Forrest, his little Ross, his Jack and
his Dick; with that greyhead, bowing, soft-handed cousin
of his, Monsieur Archibald, for secretary—hey? Very
good: you picture the young man And she!’ French
Paris threatens you with one finger, presented like a pistol
at your eyes. ‘She had one lady of company, upon my
soul, one only, the fair Seton; that one and no other with
her in a camp full of half-naked, cannibal men—for what
else are they, these Scots? She wore breastplate and
gorget of leather, a leather cap for her head, a short
red petticoat, the boots of a man. As for her hair, it
streamed behind her like a pennon in the wind. It was
hell’s weather, said Sandy Forbes; rain and gusty wind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
freshening now and again to tempest; there were quags to
be crossed, torrents to be forded; the rain drove like sleet
across the hills. Well, she throve upon it, her eyes like
stars. There was no tarrying because of her; she raced
like a coursing dog, and nearly caught the Bastard of
Scotland. He was the root of all mischance, as always in
a kingdom; for a bastard, do you see? means fire somewhere.
Have you ever heard tell of my Lord Don John
of Austria? Ah, if we are to talk of fire, look out for him.</p>

<p>‘It was in the flats below Stirling that she felt the scent
hot in her face. The Bastard had had six hours’ start; but
if spurring could have brought horses to face that weather,
she had had him in jail at this hour, or in Purgatory.
“Half my kingdom,” cries she, “sooner than lose him
now!” But he got clear away, he and Monsieur le Duc,
and the old Earl of Argyll, and Milord Rothes and the
rest of them. They crossed the March into England, and
she dared not follow them against advice. My master,
when he came, confirmed it: he would not have her
venture, knowing England as well as he did; and I need
not tell you, sir, that—for that once—he had the support
of the King. He was out of breath, that King! But, of
course! If you drink to get courage you must pay for it.
Your wind goes, and then where is your courage? In the
bottle, in the bottle! You drink again—and so you go the
vicious round.’ French Paris flips his finger and thumb,
extinguishing the King of Scots. ‘The King, sir? Pouf!
Perished, gone out, snuffered out, finished, done with—adieu!’
He kisses his hand to the sky. This is treason:
let us shift our ground.</p>

<p>‘I did not see my master’s reception, down there in the
palace: that was not for a lacquey. Very fine, very
curious, knowing what I know. They met him in the
hall, a number of the lords—none too friendly as yet, but
each waiting on the other to get a line: my Lord of
Atholl, a grave, honest man, my Lord of Ruthven, pallid,
mad and struggling with his madness, my Lord of Lindsay,
who ought to be a hackbutter, or a drawer in a tavern;
there were many others, men of no account. My master
entered on the arm of the new Earl of Huntly, just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
restored, the fine young man, to the honours of his late
father. In this country, you must know, a certain number
of the lords are always in rebellion against the King. He
imprisons, not executes, them; for he knows very well
that before long another faction will be out against him;
and then it is very convenient to release the doers in the
former. For by that act of grace you convert them into
friends, who will beat your new foes for you. They in
their turn go to prison. You know the fate of M. de
Huntly’s father, for instance—how he rebelled and died,
and was dug out of the grave that they might spit upon
his old body? The Bastard’s doing, but the Queen
allowed it. And now, here is the Bastard hiding in the
rocks, and old Huntly’s son hunting him high and low.
<i>Drôle de pays!</i> But, I was about to tell you, rebels though
we have been, they received us well—crowded about us—clapped
our shoulders—cheered, laughed, talked all at
once. My master was nearly off his feet as they bore him
down the hall towards the fire. Now, there by the fire,
warming himself, stood a nobleman, very broad in the
back, very pursy, with short-fingered, fat hands, and well-cushioned
little eyes in his face. So soon as he saw us
coming he grew red and walked away.</p>

<p>‘“Ho, ho, my Lord of Morton, whither away so fast?”
cried out my master.</p>

<p>‘And my Lord of Livingstone said: “To sit on the
Great Seal, lest Davy get it from him”; and they all
burst out laughing like a pack of boys. I suppose he is
still sitting close, for he has not been seen this long
time.</p>

<p>‘We sent up our names and waited—but we waited an
hour! Then came my Lord of Traquair and took up my
master alone. He had his glove and letter with him, I
knew. He was determined to risk them.</p>

<p>‘The Queen had nobody with her; and he told me that
the first thing she said to him was this:—“My lord, you
have things of mine which I need. Will you not give them
to me?”</p>

<p>‘He took them out of his bosom—if you know him you
will see his twinkling eyes, never off her—and held them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
up. “They have been well cared for, madam. I trust
that your Majesty will be as gentle with them.”</p>

<p>‘“They are safe with me,” says the Queen. So then,
after a fine reverence, he gave them up, and she thanked
him, and put them in her bosom; and I would give forty
crowns to know where they are now. I know where they
will be before long.</p>

<p>‘Now what do you think of that? It shows you, first,
that he was right and I wrong; for she never looked at
the thing, and any woman’s glove would have done, with
a little sea-water on the fingers. My master, let me tell
you, is a wise man, even at his wildest. He did more
good to himself by that little act than by any foolish play
of the constant lover. He showed her that she might trust
him. True. But much more than that, he showed her
that he did not need her tokens; and that was the master-stroke.</p>

<p>‘The same line he has followed ever since—he alone,
like the singling hound in a pack. He has held her at
arm’s length. She has trusted him, and shown it; he has
served her well, but at arm’s length. That Italian fiddler,
rolling about in her chamber, too much aware of his value,
takes another way. Lord forgive him! he is beginning to
play the patron. That can only lead him to one place, in
my opinion. Hated! that is a thin word to use in his
respect. He makes the lords sick with fear and loathing.
They see a toad in the Queen’s lap, as in the nursery tale,
and no one dare touch the warty thing, to dash it to the
wall. My master would dare, for sure; but he does not
choose. For all that, he says that Monsieur David is
a fool.</p>

<p>‘It is when I am trussing him in the mornings, kneeling
before him, that he speaks his mind most freely. He is
like that—you must be beneath his notice to get his
familiarity. Do you know the course he takes here in this
world of rats and women? To laugh, and laugh, and laugh
again: <i>voilà!</i> He varies his derision, of course. He will
not rally the King or put him to shame, but listens, rather,
and watches, and nods his head at his prancings, and says,
“Ha, a fine bold game, now!”; or, if he is appealed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
directly, will ask, “Sir, what am I to say to you? the same
as Brutus said to Cæsar?” “And what said Brutus?”
cries the King. “Why, sir,” replies my master, “he said,
Sooner you than me, Cæsar.” That is his favourite adage.
And so he plays with the King, his eyes twinkling and his
mouth broad, but no teeth showing. He shows neither his
teeth nor his hand. He is a good card-player; and so he
should be, who has been at the table with the Queen-Mother
Catherine, daughter of Mischief and the Apothecary.</p>

<p>‘The King hates my master without understanding;
the Queen leans on him to gain understanding; but she
has not gained it yet. You may trust my lord for that.
Did you hear of the mass on Candlemas Day, a week past
to-day? How she thought this a fine occasion to restore
the ancient use: her enemies beaten over the border, all
her friends should carry tapers, so that the Queen of
Heaven might be purified again of her spotless act? She
required it personally of all the lords, one by one, herself
beseeching them with soft eyes and motions of the hands
hard to be denied. Moreover, she is to have need of
purification herself if all goes well. For she is ... but
you can judge for yourself. Many promised her on whom
she had not counted; my master, on whom she did count,
refused her point-blank. The strangest part of the business
is, however, that his credit is higher now than it was before.
So much so that she has made him a fine marriage.
Monsieur de Huntly’s sister is the lady; I have seen her,
but reserve my judgment. I think that she will not like
me—I feel it in the ridges of my ears, a very sensitive part
with me. She was in the Queen’s circle one day—the day
on which I saw her—a statue of a woman, upon whom the
Queen cast the eyes of that lover who goes to church to
view his mistress afar off, and has no regard for any but
her, and waits and hopes, and counts every little turn of
her head—as patient as a watching dog. Curious! curious
government of women! Hey—pardon! The Council is
up. I must be forward. Sir, I thank you, and humbly
salute you.’</p>

<p>French Paris pushes through the huddle of servants, the
rosemary sprig in his mouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>My Lord Admiral the Earl of Bothwell comes out one
of the first, between the Lords Seton and Caithness. He
talks fast, you notice, with a good deal of wrist and finger-work,
acknowledges no salutations though he is offered
many. My Lord Seton takes them all upon himself,
misses not one. The Earl of Caithness is an oldish man,
rather hard of hearing. Heeding nobody, speaking as he
feels, laughing at his own jokes, capping one with another,
the burly admiral stands barehead in the raw drizzle,
swinging his feathered hat in his hand. There seems
much to say, if he could only remember it, and no hurry.
Horses are brought up, gentlemen mount by the post and
spur away. Three ushers come running, waving their
wands. ‘Sirs, the King!’ The crowd gathers; the Lord
Admiral continues his conversation.</p>

<p>The King comes out, taller by a head than most,
exceedingly magnificent, light-haired, hot in the face.
Hats and bonnets are doffed, but in silence. The great
grey stallion with red trappings is his; and he can hold it
though two grooms cannot well. He stands for a while,
pulling on his gauntlet, scowling and screwing his mouth
as he tussles with it. But the scowls, you gather, are less
for the glove than for a calm-eyed, fleshy, pink man with
a light red beard, who has emerged but just now; whose
furred cloak is over-fringed, whose bonnet sags too much
over one eye, the jewel in it too broad. This is Signior
Davy, too cool and too much master to please one who is
hot and not master of himself. You can see the King’s
mood grow furious to the point of unreason, while my
Lord Bothwell continues his tales, and the Italian, secure
in a crowd, seems to be daring an attack.</p>

<p>The King is mounted, the King is away. The crowd
drives back to right and left. He goes swinging down the
steep street, his gentlemen after him. The Earl of Bothwell
calls out, ‘Paris, my cloak.’</p>

<p>Paris turns the rosemary sprig. ‘Le voici, monseigneur.’</p>

<p>He walks away to his lodging like any plain burgess of
the town, and Paris trips jauntily after him, looking Scotchwomen
in the face.</p>

<h3 id="II_CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="smaller">GRIEFS AND CONSOLATIONS OF ADONIS</span></h3>

<p>In these dark February days the King was prone to regard
his troubles as the consequence, and not the verification, of
certain words spoken by Archie Douglas on the braeside
by Falkirk—that being a trick of the unreasonable, to date
their misfortunes from the time when they first find them
out. And yet it was an odd thing that Archie should have
spoken in his private ear shortly after Michaelmas, and
that here was Candlemas come and gone, with everything
turning to prove Archie right. Now, which of the three
was the grey-polled youth—prophet, philosopher, or bird
of boding?</p>

<p>Consider his Majesty’s affairs in order. The Queen,
before marriage and at the time of it, had been as meek
as a girl newly parted from her mother, newly launched
from that familiar shore to be seethed in the deep, secret
waters of matrimony. Something of that exquisite docility
he had discerned when he experienced, for instance, the
prerogatives of a man. One name before another is a
very small matter; but it had given him a magnanimous
thrill to read <span class="smcap">Henricus et Maria</span> upon the white money,
and to feel the confidence that <span class="smcap">Henricus et Maria</span>, in
very fact, it was now and was to be. Little things of the
sort swelled his comfort up: the style royal, the chief seat,
the gravity of the Council (attendant upon his), the awe of
the mob, the Italian’s punctilio, his father’s unfeigned
reverence. Even Mr. Randolph’s remarked abstention was
flattering, for it must have cost the ambassador more to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
ignore the King than the King could ever have to pay for
the slight. Now, a man needs time to get the flavours of
such toothsome tribute; he must roll it on his tongue, dally
over it with his intimates. Little Forrest, the chamber-child,
could have told a thing or two: how the King used
to wear his gold circlet in private, and walk the room in his
crimson mantle. Antony Standen knew something. Yes,
yes, a man needs time; and such time was denied him—and
(by Heaven!) denied him by the Queen herself.</p>

<p>By the Queen! From the hour when she heard the
news from Argyll, that the rebels, her brother at their
head, had called out the clans of the west—Campbells,
Leslies, Hamiltons—against her authority, she was a
creature whom her King had never conceived of. He was
told by Archie Douglas then, and partly believed, that she
was slighting him; but the plain truth is, of course, that
all her keen love for him was running now in a narrow
channel—that of strenuous loyalty to the young man she
had chosen to set beside her. These hounds to deny his
kingly right! Let them learn then what a King he was,
for what a King she held him! She strained every nerve,
put edge to every wit in his vindication. While he lay
abed, stretching, dreaming—sometimes of her, more often
of her love for him, most often of what he should do
when he was fairly roused: ‘Let them not try me too far,
little Forrest! I say, they had best not!’ etc.—at these
times she was in her cabinet with the Italian, writing to
her brother of France, her father of Rome, her uncles and
cousins of Lorraine, promising, wheedling, threatening,
imploring. Or she was in audience, say, with George
Gordon, winning back his devotion with smiles and tender
looks, with a hand to the chin, or two clasping her knee—with
all the girlish wiles she knew so well and so divinely
used. For his sake—that slug-abed—she dared see
Bothwell again; and greater pride hath no woman than
this, to brave the old love for the sake of the new.
Finally, when cajolery and bravado had done their best
for her, she sprang starry-eyed into battle, headed her
ragged musters in a short petticoat, and dragged him
after her in gilded armour. That is what a man—by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
mass, a King!—may fairly call being docked of his time to
get the flavours.</p>

<p>He went out unwillingly to war, with sulky English
eyes for all the petty detriments. He sniffed at her array,
her redshanks armed with bills, her Jeddart bowmen,
haggard hillmen from Badenoch and Gowrie. Where
were the broad pavilions, the camp-furniture, the pennons
and pensels, the siege-train, the led horses, the Prince’s
cloth of estate? Was he to huddle with reivers under a
pent of green boughs, and with packed cowdung keep the
wind from his anointed person? King of kings, Ruler of
princes! was <i>she</i> to do the like? How she laughed, tossed
back her hair, to hear him!</p>

<p>‘Hey, dear heart, you are in wild Scotland, where all
fare alike. O King of Scots, forget your smug England,
and teach me, the Queen, to laugh at stately France!
Battle, my prince, battle! The great game!’</p>

<p>She galloped down the line, looking back for him to
follow. Line! it was no line, but a jostling horde of
market-drovers clumped upon a knowe. There were no
formation, no livery, no standard—unless that scarecrow
scarf were one. Why should he follow her to review a
pack of thieves?</p>

<p>Hark, hark, how the rascals cheered her! They ran
all about her, tossing up their bonnets on pikes. They
were insulting her.</p>

<p>‘By God!’ he cried out, ‘who was to teach them
behaviour? Was this the King’s office?’</p>

<p>‘It is the Queen’s, my good lord; she will teach them,’
said the Italian at his elbow. ‘And what her Majesty
omits the enemy will teach them, at his own charges. I
know your countrymen by now. Manners? Out of place
in the field. Courage? They have never wanted for that.’</p>

<p>The King grew red, as he tried in vain to stare down
this confident knave; then turned to his Archie Douglas.
‘A company of my Lord Essex’s horse,’ he said, ‘would
drill these rabble like a maggoty cheese.’</p>

<p>Archie excused his nation. ‘They will trot the haggs
all day, sir, on a crust of rye-bread, and engage at the
close for a skirl of the pipes. Hearken! they are at it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
now. ’Tis the Gordons coming in.’ The thin youth drew
himself up. ‘Eh, sirs, my heart warms to it!’ he said,
honestly moved by an honest pride.</p>

<p>But the King sulked. ‘Filthy work! Where are my
people? Ho, you! my cloak!’</p>

<p>‘Ay, there comes a spit o’ rain,’ said Archie Douglas,
nosing the weather. This was no way for a man to get the
flavours of kingship.</p>

<p>In the chase that followed—forced marches on Glasgow
after old Châtelherault, the scouring of the Forth valley,
the view-halloo at Falkirk, and much more—the Queen
had to leave him alone, for so he chose it; and there was
no time to humour him, had there been inclination. But
truly there was none. She had the sting of weather and
the scurry in her blood; she was in perfect health, great
spirits, loving the work. Hunter’s work! the happy
oblivion of the short night’s rest, the privations, the relish
of simple fare, the spying and hoping, the searching of
hillsides and descents into sombre valleys, your heart in
your mouth; all the trick and veer of mountain warfare,
the freedoms, the easy talk, the laughing, the horseplay;
she found nothing amiss, kept no state, and never felt the
lack of it. The Italian and his letter-case, Lethington
and his dockets, were behind. Atholl watched Edinburgh
Castle for her, Bothwell was coming home; she had none
with her but Mary Seton for countenance, Carwood for
use, one page (Adam Gordon), one esquire (Erskine), and
Father Roche. For the rest, her cousin and councillor
and open-air comrade was George Gordon, late in bonds.
So sometimes a whole day would pass without word to
the King; later, as at Falkirk, where the scent had been
so hot, three or four days; and she never missed him!</p>

<p>This was the occasion when Archie Douglas, riding
with his kinsman, had pointed to the head of the valley,
saying, ‘There goes a man in good company, who lately
was glad of any.’ The King scowled, which encouraged
him. ‘Ay,’ he went on—‘ay, the favour of the prince can
lift up and cast down. Who’d ha’ thought, sirs, that yon
Geordie Gordon should be son of a disgraced old body,
that must be dug free from the worms before he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
be punished enough? And now Geordie’s in a fair way
for favours, and hath his bonny earldom almost under his
hand. Eh, sirs, that put your trust in princes, go warily
your ways!’</p>

<p>Ruthven, by his side, nudged him to be done with it.</p>

<p>‘No, no, my lord,’ cries Archie, ‘I’ll not be silenced
when I see my kinsman slighted; him and his high rights
passed over for an outlaw!’</p>

<p>These words were used, ‘slighted,’ ‘passed over.’ The
words rankled, the things signified came to pass, as surprisingly
they will when once you begin to look for
them.</p>

<p>First sign:—Early in the winter, so soon as the war was
over and Scotland ridded for a time of declared enemies,
the Earl of Bothwell came home whilst the King was at
Linlithgow, was received by her Majesty, and (it seems)
made welcome. No doubt but he made use of her kindness
to line his own nest; at any rate, one of the first
things asked of the returning monarch was to appoint
this Bothwell Lieutenant-General of the South and Lord
Admiral of Scotland. The parchments came before him
for the sign-manual. O prophet Archibald! he found the
Queen’s name already upon them.</p>

<p>He raised an outcry. ‘The Earl of Bothwell! The
Earl of Bothwell! How much more grace for this outlaw?
Is it not enough that he return with his head on his
shoulders?’</p>

<p>She replied that he had deserved well of both of them.
He had scared her shameful brother out of Scotland, who
would have gone for no other body. He had a stout heart,
had promised her that Moray should die an alien or a felon,
and would keep his word.</p>

<p>‘But this office is a promise to my father, madam,’ says
the King. ‘I promised him that Lieutenancy six months
since, and may no more go back upon my word than my
Lord Bothwell upon his.’</p>

<p>Rather red in the face, she urged her reasons. ‘That
is not convenient, dear friend. They do not love my Lord
of Lennox in the West. There are other reasons—good
reasons. Had you been here you would have heard them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
all. You must not vex me in this, now—of all times in
my life.’</p>

<p>He looked her up and down curiously, without manners,
without enthusiasm. Perhaps he did not understand her—he
had a thick head. Then he signed the dockets and
went out, not having seen that she had shut her eyes and
was blushing.</p>

<p>Dreadfully jealous of his ‘prerogatives,’ he interposed
in everything after this, had all state correspondence before
him and saw all the replies, whether they were of home or
abroad. Here the Italian angered him, whose habit had
always been to converse with her Majesty in French: no
frowns nor furious pacing of the closet could break him off
it. The Queen, very gentle towards him, insisted that the
secretary should paraphrase his letters into a kind of Scots;
but the King, who was stupid at business, boggled over
the halting translation, did not understand any more than
at first, and suspected the Italian of deliberate mystification.
He told the Queen that she should speak the
vernacular with this hireling. She said, and truly, that
she thought in French and spoke it better; when, nevertheless,
she tried to gratify him, even he saw that it was
absurd. Absurd or not, he loved David none the better
for that.</p>

<p>He suspected everybody about her person, but chiefly
this fat Italian; to whose score he laid his next rebuff, the
very palpable hit that it was. The old Duke of Châtelherault,
exiled for the late rebellion, was pining in England,
it seems, and beginning to ail. Shallow old trickster as he
might be, he loved his country and his kindred, and was
(as the Queen could never forget) head of the Hamiltons,
of the blood royal. He crept back in December over the
Solway, and from one of his coast-castles sent humble
messengers forward to her for pardon and remission of
forfeiture. To these she inclined, on more grounds than
one. She had some pity for the old hag-ridden man,
haunted ever with the shadow of madness as he was; she
remembered his white hair and flushing, delicate face.
Then her new Earl of Huntly had married into that
family; and she wished to keep a hold on the Gordons.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
And then, again, the blood royal! She forgot that if she
could comfortably admit Châtelherault his share in that,
her husband could never admit it without impeaching his
own rights. So she inclined to the piteous letters, and
allowed herself to be pitiful.</p>

<p>The King, on the first hint of this clemency, was moved
beyond her experience. No sulking, brooding, knitting of
brows; he fairly stormed at her before her circle. ‘What
am I, madam? What silly tavern-sign do you make of
me? You exalt my chief enemy, my hereditary enemy,
enemy of my title to be here—and ask me to record it!
King Henry is to declare his esteem for the Hamiltons,
who desire to unking him! This is paltry work, the design
too gross. I see foreign fingers at work in this. But I will
never consent, never! Ask me no more.’</p>

<p>The Italian surveyed his august company at large, lifted
his eyebrows, and blandly, patently, deliberately shrugged.
My Lord of Bothwell himself had little stomach for this;
but the King strangled a cry and turned upon his insolent
critic. ‘White-blooded, creeping, fingering dog!’ He
drew his dagger on the man, and for the moment scared
the life out of him.</p>

<p>Lord Bothwell stepped in between, a broad-shouldered
easy gentleman; the next step was the Queen’s, flame-hued
now, and at her fiercest. ‘Put up your weapon, my lord,
and learn to be the companion of your prince. Until this
may be, the Council is dissolved. Farewell, sirs. David,
stay you here. I have need of you.’</p>

<p>Bothwell and Huntly, they say, fairly led him out of
the presence. Good lack, here was Proof the Second!
The companion of his prince! He would certainly have
killed the Italian had not the Queen taken care that he
should not.</p>

<p>Once more he went away, and stayed away. He would
wait until she felt the need of him, he said to his friends
Archie Douglas and Ruthven, who never left him now.
On this occasion the Master of Lindsay was of the party,
which rode into the Carse of Gowrie, hunting the fox.
Hacked son of a fighting father, worse companion he could
not have had—saving the presence of the other two—than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
Lindsay of the burnt face and bloodshot eye. ‘The King
with many friends!’ said Bothwell when he heard how
they set out. ‘Smarthering Archie to stroke him tender,
Ruthven to scrape him raw, and now Lindsay with his
fire-hot breath to inflame the part! Geordie, we must fend
for the Queen.’ Huntly, sublimely in love, conscious of
his growth in grace, said that he was ready.</p>

<p>With the aid of these two advancing noblemen her
Majesty’s government went on. She gave the Hamiltons
hard terms, which they took abjectly enough; she pardoned
Argyll, because he must be separated from his former
friends; the rest of the rebels were summoned to surrender
to her mercy at the Market Cross; failing that, forfeiture
of lands and goods for my Lord of Moray. The day
fixed for him was the 12th March. Huntly was sure
he would not come, but Bothwell shook his head. ‘Keep
your eye on Mr. Secretary’s letter-bag, madam, and let
him know that you do it. I shall feel more restful o’
nights when we are over the 12th March. Another
thing you may do: throw him into the company of your
brown-eyed Fleming. Does your Majesty know that
property of a dish of clear water—to take up the smell
of the room you set it in? Your Lethington has that
property, therefore let him absorb your little Fleming; you
will have him as dovelike as herself.’ The advice was
taken, and Mr. Secretary rendered harmless for the
present.</p>

<p>Then came news of the King’s return; but not the King.
He was certainly at Inchkeith, said gossip—Inchkeith, an
island in the Firth; but when she asked what he did
there, she got confused replies. Bothwell said that he was
learning to govern. ‘He has been told, madam, do you
see? that if he can rule Lindsay and Ruthven in three
roods of land he will have no trouble with Scotland
afterwards.’</p>

<p>The Queen, although she suffered this light-hearted
kind of criticism without rebuke, did not reply to it, nor
did she let Bothwell see that she was anxious. The Italian
saw it, however, whether she would or no, and took care to
give her every scrap of news. She learned from him that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
the King was drinking there, fuddling himself. He was
holding a Court, where (as Bothwell had guessed) he was
easily King, throned on a table, with a ‘lovely Joy’ on
either hand. She had the names of his intimates, with
exact particulars of their comings and goings. The Earl
of Morton was not above suspicion; he went there by
night always, cloaked and in a mask. The Queen, more
conscious of her power since the rebellion, conscious now
of her matronly estate, grew sick to have such nasty
news about her—it was as if the air was stuck with flies.
Presently she fell sick in good truth, with faintings, pains
in her side, back-soreness, breast-soreness, heart-soreness.
It did not help her to remember that she must be at
Linlithgow at Christmas, and meet the King there.</p>

<p>Lying in her bed, smothered in furs, shivering, tossing
herself about—for she never could bear the least physical
discomfort—she chewed a bitter cud in these dark days,
and her thoughts took a morbid habit. She fretted over
the Court at Inchkeith, imagined treasons festering there
and spreading out like fungus to meet the rebels in
England; distrusted Bothwell because he did not choose
to come to her, Huntly because he did not dare; she distrusted,
in fact, every Scot in Scotland, and found herself
thereby clinging solely to the Italian; and of him—since
she must speak to somebody—she consequently saw too
much. The man was very dextrous, very cheerful, very
willing; but he had a gross mind, and she had spoiled
him. To be kind to a servant, nine times in ten, means
that you make him rich at your own charges, and then
he holds cheap what his own welfare has diminished. So
it was here: Davy was not the tenth case. She had
been bountiful in friendship, confidence, familiarity—of
the sort which friends may use and get no harm of.
He had always amused her, and now he soothed and
strengthened her at once by sousing her hot fancies in
the cold water of his common-sense. She had learned to
fear the workings of her own mind, informed as it was by
a passionate heart; she would lean upon this honest fellow,
who never looked for noonday at eleven o’clock, and
considered that a purge or a cupping was the infallible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
remedy for all ailments, including broken hearts. It is
not for you or me, perhaps, to complain where she did
not. Queen Mary was no precisian, to expect more than
she asked. If she loved she must be loved back; if she
commanded she must be obeyed; if she was hipped she
must be amused. I believe Signior Davy gave himself
airs and made himself comfortable. She found the first
ridiculous and the second racial. She knew that chivalry
was not a virtue of that land where bargaining is at its
best, and that where her Italian saw a gate open he would
reasonably go in. The odds are that he presumed insufferably;
certain it is that, though she never saw it, others
saw nothing else, and, gross-minded themselves, misread
it grossly. The tale was all about the town that Signior
Davy was the Queen’s favourite, and where he was always
to be found, and what one might look for, and who was
to be pitied, etc. etc. The revellers at Inchkeith advised
each other to mark the end, and some were for telling the
King. But Archie Douglas was against that. ‘Tell him
now,’ he said, ‘and see your salmon slip through the net.
Wait till Davy’s in the boat, man, and club him then.’</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the deft Italian, by his cold douches, his
playing the fool, his graceless reminiscences and unending
novels, cured the Queen. Late in December she astonished
the Court by holding a council in person—in a person,
moreover, as sharp and salient as a snow-peak glittering
through the haze of frost, and as incisive to the touch.
There were proclamations to be approved: ‘The King’s
and Queen’s Majesties considering,’ etc., the common form.
These must be altered, she said. ‘The Queen’s Majesty
by the advice of her dearest husband’: she would have it
thus for the future. Tonic wit of the Italian! for to whom
else, pray, could you ascribe it? The word went flying
about that the style was changed, and was not long in
coming to Inchkeith. ‘The Queen’s husband!’ Ill news
for Inchkeith here.</p>

<p>Yet, the night he had it, he gloomed over it—being in
his cups—with a kind of slumberous gaiety stirring under
his rage.</p>

<p>‘The Queen’s husband! By the Lord, and I am the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
Queen’s husband. Who denies it is a liar. Archie Douglas,
Archie Douglas, if you say I am not the Queen’s husband
you lie, man.’</p>

<p>‘I, sir?’ says Archie, very brisk. ‘No, sir, I am very
sure of it. By my head, sir, and her Majesty knows it.’</p>

<p>‘She ought to know it. She shall know it. I’m a rider,
my lords; I ride with the spur.’</p>

<p>‘’Tis the curb you lack,’ says Ruthven, with a harsh
laugh.</p>

<p>The blinking youth pondered him and his words. ‘I’m
for the spur and a loose rein, Ruthven. I get the paces
out of my nags. I have the seat.’</p>

<p>‘Half of it, say, my lord!’</p>

<p>Everybody heard that except the King, who went
grumbling on. ‘You shall not teach me how to sit a
horse. I say you shall not, man.’</p>

<p>‘My lord,’ cried Lindsay, who never would call him
‘sir,’ ‘the talk is not of horse-riding. If we use that
similitude for the Queen’s government, I tell your lordship
it is unhappy. For on that horse of government there be
two riders, I think; and of what advantage is the loose
rein of your lordship when your fellow uses the curb?’</p>

<p>‘Ay my good lord, you hit the mark. Two riders, two
riders, by God’s fay!’</p>

<p>The same voice as before—heard this time by the King.
No one knew who had spoken, nor were the words more
explicitly offensive than Lindsay’s; but the pothouse tone
of them caught the muzzy ear, hit some quick spot in the
cloudy brain, and stung like fire. The King lifted up his
head to listen; he opened his mouth and stared, as if he
saw something revealed beyond the window, some warning
or leering face. Then he rose and held by his chair.
‘Two riders? Two riders? Two! Who said that? By
heaven and hell, bring me that man!’</p>

<p>The pain, the horror he had, the helpless rage, made a
dead hush all over; nobody stirred. Ridiculous he may
have been, as he raised his voice yet higher and mouthed
his words—worthless he was known to be—and yet he
was tragic for the moment. ‘I say it is damnable lying,’
he said, swaying about. ‘I say that man shall go to deep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
hell.’ He stared round the hall, at his wits’ end. His
wits made a pounce. ‘Archie, thou black thief, ’twas
thou!’</p>

<p>‘No, sir; no, upon my soul.’</p>

<p>‘Ruthven, if you have dared—Lindsay—Fleming! Oh,
mercy and truth!’</p>

<p>The rest was hideous.</p>

<p>They got him to bed between them, while little Forrest
cried and made a fuss, praying them to kill him sooner
than leave him with his master in the raving dark. No
one took any notice of the anguish of a boy.</p>

<p class="tb">With time came counsel, and friends very free with it.
Even prudence made herself heard in that brawling house.
The King should meet his consort at Linlithgow, do his
duty by her, observe the Christmas feast.</p>

<p>‘You will do well, sir—though I am sore to say it—to
hear the popish mass,’ he was advised: ‘with reservation
of conscience, the stroke would be politic.’</p>

<p>He agreed with all such advice; he intended to be wise.
But the grand stroke of all was the Earl of Morton’s, to
devise a way by which the injured husband could point the
King’s demands with that undoubted right of his. The
Crown-Matrimonial, resounding phrase! let him ask her to
give him that. Nobody was prepared to say what was or
was not this Crown-Matrimonial, or whether there was such
a crown. The term was unknown to the law, that must be
owned; and yet it had a flavour of law. It was double-armed,
yet it was hyphenated; you could not deny part of
it in any event. Why, no, indeed! cried Inchkeith at
large, highly approving.</p>

<p>Archie Douglas cheered his noble kinsman: ‘Hail,
King-Matrimonial of Scotland!’</p>

<p>Ruthven grinned, it was thought, approvingly; but
Lord Morton, remembering that he was still the Queen’s
Chancellor and should not go too far, made haste to advise
the utmost delicacy. Above all things, let no breath of
<i>his</i> dealings be heard.</p>

<p>‘I need not affirm my earnest hope,’ he said, ‘that
peace and good accord may come out of this. The wish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
must find acceptance in every Christian heart. As such
I utter it. I am not in place to do more. I cannot
admonish; I serve the State.’</p>

<p>The King nodded sagely.</p>

<p>‘Good, cousin, good. I take your meaning. It is a
fair intent, for which I am much beholden to you.’
Adonis, the proud rider, was chastened just now.</p>

<p>They met, therefore, at Linlithgow, heard mass together,
made their offerings, and to all the world were
friends again. The Crown-Matrimonial lay hidden until
the spring of the year. Not even the new coinage—<span class="smcap">Maria
et Henricus</span>, ‘the dam before the sire’—tempted it
out; but there were reasons for that. A week after the
Epiphany, as they were in the Queen’s closet with a small
company, she took his hand and said: ‘My lord, you
shall hereafter give me what worship you can; for now I
know of a certainty that I have deserved well of you and
Scotland.’ Her pride in the fact and something of pity for
herself made her voice quiver.</p>

<p>He started and flushed quickly. ‘Is it true, madam?
Is that the case? Oh, I thank God for it!’</p>

<p>He would not let go of her hand, but waited impatiently
until those present took the hint and retired; then took
her, kissed her, and called her his Mary again.</p>

<p>She cried contentedly enough, her cheek against his
heart; and he, at once triumphant and generous, father
and lover, stayed by her for a whole day and night.</p>

<p>There was much talk, as you may suppose. The maids
went about with their heads in the air, as if they had
achieved something. But apart from them, all the talk
was not of this complacent kind. Mr. Randolph, for
instance, wrote to his patron, Mr. Cecil, of England: ‘The
Queen is with child beyond a doubt. She informed the
King in my hearing. Now, woe is me for you when
David’s son shall be King in England!’ And there is no
doubt that what Mr. Randolph took leave to report was
no news to the late revellers of Inchkeith.</p>

<h3 id="II_CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="smaller">DIVERS USES OF A HARDY MAN</span></h3>

<p>In all her late perplexities of disordered mind, unsteady
hand, chagrin, disenchantment, and what not, it is strange
to observe with what tenacity the Queen kept a daily
glance of her eyes for one private affair. It was an affair
of the heart, however.</p>

<p>Those who know her best explain that she suffered from
a malady of the affections. ‘The Queen my mistress,’
says Des-Essars in <i>Le Secret des Secrets</i>, ‘when she had
once seen—even for a few moments only—man, woman, or
child in whom lay, somewhere, some little attractive quality
or action, could never rest until she had him subject
utterly to her will. Subject, do I say? The word is weak.
The devotion which she must have was so absolute that
she never got it, could hardly ever deceive herself that she
had got it; and would have spurned it at once if she had,
as a grovelling thing not worth a thought. But, just
because she never could get it, she never tired of the
pursuit of it. To get it she would humble herself, lower
herself, make herself ridiculous, cheapen herself; to hold
what she had (or thought she had) she would play any
part, tell most fibs, do much injustice to herself and the
unfortunate capture; to lose after all was to suffer torments
of baffled hope and endeavour; and then—to begin again
upon some similar panting quest. Sometimes she sickened,
but of possession, never of pursuit; and if she did, it was
an infallible sign that the thing she had had been too
easily caught. Thus she sickened of “Adonis,” not because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
he had been restive at first, but because he had not been
restive until after he was won. She had longed for him,
wooed him, wed him in secret. All was going well. If
ever her cup of joy had brimmed over, it had been on that
night of sudden consummation at Wemyss. That golden,
beaded cup! there had seemed a well-spring in it, a feast
to be enjoyed for ever in secret, by delicious, hasty snatches.
But when they ordered the affair in public, it was stale
after the event; and when he—the fool—cried over her the
mort o’ the deer (as I know he did, for Sir Adam Gordon
heard him), it had been his own death, not hers, that he
proclaimed. Sated too soon, she had time to see herself
and to shudder at the wry image she made.</p>

<p>‘I know very well,’ he adds, in an afterthought, ‘that,
in saying this, I may be taken as an example to point my
own thesis; but even if I were, the reflections are just.
And the fact is that, although she knew that I loved her,
and might, indeed, have loved me, she learned of my
manhood too late. I can add also, with a hand on my
heart, that she would never have had to pursue me. For I
was always at her feet.’</p>

<p>But to return to my matter—this affair of the heart. It
most curiously bears out Des-Essars’ analysis to remember
that when she released George Gordon from his bonds, and
had him once more spilling love at her feet, she was by no
means touched. The sanguine young man loved her, she
knew it well; but she always felt a little leap of scorn for
a man who could own to loving her. It made him seem
womanish in her eyes, like Châtelard. And in the very
act—when he was below her footstool, ready to kiss her
foot—she remembered that there was one Gordon whom
she had not yet won. She remembered Jean Gordon, who,
on that day of Gordon’s Bane, had looked at her fixedly,
with grave dislike—had had the nerve to survey her Queen
and judge and pick out what parts to despise. She had
rarely seen her since, but had never forgotten her. Deep
in her burning heart she had cherished the hope of winning
that frozen heart; and here—with George Gordon kissing
her foot—sat she, curiously pondering how far she could
use the brother to lure the sister into the net.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>There was nothing unholy about this desire of hers to
subdue a girl’s heart. It was coloured by impulses which
were warm and rich and chivalrous. Had it been that of a
youth there would not be a word to say; there was much
of the quality of a youth about Queen Mary. She certainly
had his chivalry—for chivalry is really pity, with a relish—a
noble emotion which reacts by exalting the percipient.
She saw herself protector of this friendless girl, felt kindly
the very kindly kiss which she would bestow: it should fall
like dew upon the upturned, stony face. At its fall the
cold and dread would thaw, tears would well in those
judging eyes, the hardened lips would quiver, the congealed
bosom would surge; sobbing, grieving, murmuring her
thankful love, Jeannie Gordon would hasten into forgiving
arms. O mercy of the forgiven! O grace of the forgiving!
The picture was pure, the desire (I repeat) honest—but there
was glory to be gained too, a vision to be made good of the
Queen playing the lover’s part, worth every shift of the
quick head, and all the cajolery of the sidelong eyes. Ah
me! Here was a chase-royal.</p>

<p>Giving George Gordon kind words, and hope of kinder,
she had his mother and sister to Court, and to them was
sincerity, princely magnanimity itself. The old Countess
was soon won over: there came a day when she would not
hear a word against her Majesty, and would judge her dead
husband’s actions sooner than allow her patroness to be
condemned in their defence. Her two sons stood by her—both
lovers of this divine huntress; so that the house of
Huntly was in ascension, and Des-Essars, feeling that his
nose was (as they say) out of joint, showed that he felt it
by patronising his comrade Adam.</p>

<p>But Adam disarmed him. ‘My brother is to be Earl
again, Baptist, and therefore I am Sir Adam. You do
wrong to refuse me the salute. But let be. To you I shall
always be plain Adam Gordon, because we share the same
adventure. Now let me tell you. She kissed me yestere’en—here.’
He touched his forehead. ‘I owe you nothing
for civility, yet I’ll not go back upon my bond. You shall
take your joy of the place: it is your right.’ Then they
made it up; Adam pursued his family up the hill of fame.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
‘It is all in a fair way; look now, I’ll tell you a secret.
The Bastard is out in arms; but if we win he will lose his
head, and then Moray shall be ours again! Who knows
what may come of that? Be sure, however, that I shall
not forget you, Baptist. No, no. What I win of <i>you know
what</i> shall be yours to the full half.’ He owned that he
was vexed with his sister. ‘What! she sulks in the
presence—she holds back—like a child fighting a blown
fire! ’Tis unmaidenly of Jeannie; I doubt her a true
Gordon. And talks of the Béguines of Bruges, doth she?
Let her go, say I.’ All this judgment of Jeannie’s case, as
the reader perceives, was before the chasing of the Earl of
Moray, and before the Earl of Bothwell came home with
French Paris, his candid valet. A word now of him.</p>

<p>He arrived in Scotland, you will remember, when her
war with rebels was as good as over. She was keen;
flushed with one triumph, and sanguine of another.
Scotland at her feet, and all the Gordons hers but one:
how was stubborn Jeannie to hold out against her? She
was wedded, she was safe, she was victorious, she was
happy: everything combined to make the redoubtable
Bothwell welcome to her. It was possible, she found, to
meet him without quickening of the breath; it was possible
to look coolly at him, and (O marvel!) to ask herself what
under heaven she had once dreaded in him. His eyes?
Had they seemed audacious? They were small and
twinkling. His throat, jaw, and snarling mouth—had they
seemed purposeful and cruel? The one was forward and
the other curved, just ready to laugh. Well, is a laughing
man dangerous to women? When she considered that,
less than a year ago, she had written secretly to the man,
sent him a glove, and with that a fib, she could contemplate
herself in the act, as one may a pale old picture of oneself
(in curls and a pinafore) at some childish game—with
humorous self-pity, and with some anxious regrets too.
The thing was well done with—over and done with; but
heigho! the world had been more ventureful then. He
gave her back her faded tokens; they came from his bosom
and went into hers—no thrills! They were quite cold
when she laid them by.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>He joined the field with her, or what was left of it, and
brought with him the Border clans—Elliots, Armstrongs,
Turnbulls, and his own Hepburns—ragged and shoeless,
less breeched than the Highlanders, if that were possible;
but men of dignity and worth, as she saw them, square-bearded,
broad-headed men, tawny as foxes, blunt, unmannerly,
inspecting her and her two women without awe
or curiosity. They were like their chief, she thought, and,
with him to lead them, never lagged in the chase. Huntly
had his Gordons; and there were Forbeses, Grants, Ogilvies.
Breechless were they—some at least—but of great manners;
they had poets among them, and her beauty was the theme
of harp-strings as well as eye-strings. The pipes swelled
and screamed in her daily praise; fine music, great air!
But those glum, ruminating Borderers, to whom she was
just a ‘long bit lassock’! She turned to them again
directly the piping was stopped—to them and their chief,
who was of them, blood and bone. Twice she traversed
Scotland in their midst, watching them by day, dreaming
of them by night. Just as little could she do without this
bracing, railing Bothwell as without proud Jeannie Gordon,
whom she loved in vain.</p>

<p>And thus the combination came, as in a flash, the old
beloved scheme of unity—north and south to awe the
middle parts of Scotland. Old Huntly had proposed it
and failed—it had been the death of him; but now she
would try it and succeed. Into the north she would put a
new Huntly; out of the south she would call a new Bothwell.
A match, a match! The thought came to her with
a ringing sound of hopeful music, ‘Now I have thee mine,
proud Jeannie Gordon!’ Strange, ardent, wilful creature—half
perverse, half unsexed! Because a man did not
love her she would trust him, because a girl would have
nothing to say to her she could never let her alone! But
Master Des-Essars was right. She was a born huntress.</p>

<p>The preliminaries of the hopeful match were easily
made: Huntly was grateful, the dowager profuse; Bothwell
chuckled when he was sounded about it, but declined
to discuss so simple a matter.</p>

<p>‘You’ll never find me backward, my friend,’ he told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
Huntly (as George Gordon now was called); ‘many indeed
have complained that I am not backward enough. I’m a
bull in a pasture—I’m an invading host—I devastate, I
come burning. But there! have it as you will.’</p>

<p>Nobody else was consulted, for nobody else was worth
it in the Queen’s eyes. When time had been given for all
to sink in, she sent for Jean Gordon; who was brought by
her mother to the door of the cabinet, put through it, and
left there face to face with her careful Majesty. The time
of year was mid-January.</p>

<p class="tb">The Queen sat upon a heap of cushions by the fire,
leaning back a little to ease herself. Her chin was in her
hand—a sign that she was considering. She wore a rich
gown of murrey-coloured satin, showed her red stockings
and long, narrow slippers. Her condition was not hid, and
her face would have told it in any case—pinched, peaked,
and pettish. Her eyes were like a cat’s, shifty and ranging,
now golden-red, now a mask of green, now all black,
according as she glanced them to the light; her thin,
amorous lips looked like a scarlet wound in her pale face.
By her side stood Mary Fleming, a gentle creature in pale
rose, as if set there that by her very humanity she might
enhance the elfin spell of the other. This Queen was like
a young witch, rather new to the dangerous delight, but
much in earnest.</p>

<p>She looked up sideways at the girl by the door—a girl
to the full as tall as she, and much more sumptuous:
deep-breasted, beautiful, composed, a figure of a nun in her
black and ivory. For her hair was perfect black and her
face without a tinge; and all her gown was black, with a
crucifix of silver hung from her waist. She clasped her
hands over it as she stood waiting.</p>

<p>‘Come, my girl,’ said the Queen.</p>

<p>Jean took a few steps forward and knelt down. It
seems that she might have pleased if she had done it
sooner.</p>

<p>‘Very well: it’s very well,’ the Queen began; and then,
‘No! it is not at all well! You seek my hand to kiss it.
You shall not have it!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>She put one hand below the other, and watched for the
effect. There was none. Provoking!</p>

<p>‘Why should I give my hand to a little rebel,’ she went
on again, ‘who says in her heart, “My mother is beguiled,
my brothers are beguiled, but I will never be”? who says
again, “If she gives me her hand, and I kiss it, ’twill be
because I dare not bite it”? Why then should I give my
hand to you?’</p>

<p>‘You should not, madam,’ says Jean.</p>

<p>The Queen bit her lip.</p>

<p>‘Oh, the guarded, darkened heart of you, Jean! Why,
if I bore a grudge as hardly as you, whom should I not
drive out of Scotland?’</p>

<p>As Jean made no answer, Fleming was brought into
play.</p>

<p>‘Answer for her, Fleming. Tell her I should drive
them all out. Should my brother have stayed? He is too
happy in England, I think. Shall I keep your Lethington
at home?’</p>

<p>Poor Fleming coloured with pain.</p>

<p>‘Nay, child, nay—I am teasing thee. I know that if he
will not kiss my hand ’tis because he hopes for thine. And
belike he can have it for the asking! Alack, this Lethington
with his two wicked hands! One he will hold out to
England, and my false brother Moray will take it; one to
Scotland, and pretty Fleming hath it. A chain, a chain!
to pen the naughty Queen, who will not let traitors kiss
her hands, and must be taught better respect for liars, lick-spittles,
and time-servers!’</p>

<p>She was working herself to be dangerous. Good
Fleming’s whisper in her ear, ‘Dear, sweet madam, deal
not too harshly!’ might have been heard, had not Jean
Gordon been kneeling there, stinging her to worse.</p>

<p>‘Harshly, harshly, my girl?’ the Queen snapped at
Fleming. ‘I am water heaving against that rock—torn
ragged by its fret, and scattered to the wind—to drop down
as tears—as salt tears, Mary Fleming! Ah, the sea will
drink up my tears, and the sea have me at last, and lap me
to soft sleep, and soothe me that I forget!’ She changed
her mood, looked proudly at the kneeling girl. ‘You, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
will not kiss my hand—nor shall not—you are to forget
what you choose and remember what you choose; but of
me you expect—what, O heaven! My memory is to lie in
your lap and obey you. Oh, it is very well! I am to
forget that your father was a traitor——’</p>

<p>The girl’s eyes met hers directly.</p>

<p>‘He was none, madam.’</p>

<p>‘I say I am to forget that, and remember that I dealt
sternly with an old man.’</p>

<p>Jean grew fiercely white. ‘Barbarously, madam!’ she
said; ‘when you dragged a dead old man from the grave
and spat upon his winding-sheet.’</p>

<p>‘Hush, hush!’ said Mary Fleming; and Jean looked at
her, but said no more. The Queen was very pale, lying
on her side, crouched among the cushions.</p>

<p>‘He defied me,’ she said, ‘but I forgave him that. He
tampered with my enemies, he boasted and lied and
cheated. He died in arms against his prince, and I shed
tears in pity of myself. For then I was new in Scotland,
and thought that the love of a man was something worth,
and shivered when I lost it, as one left bare to the gales.
Now I know wiselier concerning mannish love; and I know
how to draw it since I hold it cheap. I would as soon
draw that of dogs and apes, I think.’ She looked over
her shoulder, then quickly pillowed her cheek again, but
held up her hand. Mary Fleming took it. ‘Dogs, and
apes, and tigers are men, Mary Fleming!’ the complaining
voice resumed; ‘and I Dame Circe at her spells! And
here before me, look you, poor faithful, chaste Penelope,
that will not touch my hand!’</p>

<p>She gave a little moan, and sat up, shaking her head.
‘No, no, no, my girl, you have the wrong of me. I weave no
spells, I want no dogs and apes—no man’s desire. Love!’
she clasped her hands at the stretch of her arms, ‘Love! I
want love—and have it from all women but you. I am the
queen of women’s hearts, and you are my only rebel. Love
me, Jean! Forgiveness, <i>ma mie</i>!’</p>

<p>There was no answer. The Queen started forward,
almost frenzied, and threw herself upon the girl—encircled
her, clung, and began to kiss her. She kissed her lips,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
cheeks, eyes, and hair; she stroked her face, she begged and
prayed. ‘Love me, Jeannie: I have done you no wrong.
I had no hand in it—I could not move alone. I cried, but
could not move. They would have it so. Oh, love me,
my dear, for the sake of what I have bought and paid for!’</p>

<p>A flint-stone would have thawed under such a lava-stream.
Jean Gordon took a softer tinge, but tried to free
herself.</p>

<p>‘I thank your Majesty—I would not seem too hard.
Maybe I have been stiff, maybe I have brooded. There
has been too much thinking time, sitting at work for ever
in our dark house. I thank your Majesty—I thank your
Grace.’</p>

<p>The Queen lay back again, smiling through her tears.
Mary Fleming, deeply moved, took her hand and lifted it,
holding it out—by look and gesture commanding the other
to do it reverence. So it was done at last.</p>

<p>The Queen said softly: ‘I thank you, child; I thank
you, Jeannie. You make me happier. Trust me now, and
sit beside me. I have a matter for your ears, and for your
heart too, as I hope.’</p>

<p>So Jean sat staidly by her on the cushions and heard
the marriage-plan. All she could find to say was that
she hoped it would give satisfaction to her Majesty.</p>

<p class="tb">The Earl of Bothwell, then, was married upon the Lady
Jean Gordon on 24th February, at Holyrood, by the Protestant
rite. The Queen and Court were there, she very
scornful and full of mockery of what was done. She said,
and loudly, ‘If the bride is content with this munchance,
why should I be discontent?’ meaning, of course, that there
was every reason in the world why she should be. But the
truth was that the bride, who professed the old religion,
had no choice; for the Earl had insisted upon the minister
and his sermon at the price of marriage whatsoever, and
the lady’s brother Huntly shared his opinion. Whereupon
the bride had shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>‘I am bought and sold already,’ she said; ‘therefore
what matter to me whether the market is out of the
statute?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>The Queen laughed. ‘Tu as rayson, ma belle,’ she said.
‘Le vray mariage s’est faict ailleurs.’</p>

<p>And Lady Jeannie replied in a low voice, ‘Nous verrons,
madame.’</p>

<p>All things accomplished, and the Queen gone out by
her private door, the Earl handed his Countess through
the press to the great entry. Many people came surging
about them; the courtyard seemed chockablock, with
vexed cries tossed here and there, both ‘God bless the
Queen!’ and ‘God damn the Paip!’ In the midst of all
the Countess makes as if to falter, cries out, ‘Oh, my foot
hurts me!’ gets free her hand and stoops. What was she
about?</p>

<p>The Earl, who was quickly put out when he was playing
a part (as he surely was just now), stood by for a little,
twitching his cheek-bones. Anything would have vexed
him at such a time, and at any time he scorned a mob.
So he pushed forward to clear more space, crying roughly,
with his arms abroad, ‘Out, out, ye tups!’ He made
himself an open way to the doors, and stood on the
threshold of the chapel, very fierce, plucking at his beard,
his hat over his brows. There was room behind and before
him: in front were the grooms and servants with their
masters’ swords. ‘I dare ye to move, ye babbling thieves,’
he seemed to be threatening them, and kept them mute by
the power of the eye.</p>

<p>Meantime the Countess rises from her foot, puts her
hand on a young man’s shoulder near by, and says, ‘Take
you me.’ This young man, grave and personable, is Mr.
Alexander Ogilvy of Boyne, whom I hope you remember to
have seen last fighting with her brother, John of Findlater,
in the Luckenbooths, that day when the Gordons came
swelling into Edinburgh to see the new Queen. He was
an old sweetheart of hers, and might have had her but for
that unlucky encounter. And since he was here—was it for
his sake that the Countess Jeannie had hurt her foot? It
is uncertain.</p>

<p>However—‘Fear not, lady, but I’ll take you where you
please,’ he assures her; and walks out of church, her hand
upon his shoulder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus they come level with the Earl, and pass him.</p>

<p>‘How now, wife?’ he cries: ‘so soon!’</p>

<p>‘Even so, my lord, since you are so tardy,’ says she,
without a look his way.</p>

<p>This Mr. Ogilvy walks directly into the crowd, which
makes a way for him, hugely tickled by his spirit, and
closes in upon him after. The Earl lets fly a sounding
oath, and starts after them. ‘By——and——, but I’m
for you!’</p>

<p>They let him through; they cry, ‘Earl Bothwell is
after his lady! The hunt is up—toho!’ There was
much laughter, driving, flacking of hands; and the women
were the worst.</p>

<p class="tb">After dinner, dancing: the Queen in wild spirits, handed
about from man to man, and (not content with that) dancing
with the women when men flagged. Her zest carried her
far out of politics; wary in the chamber, she was like one
drunk at a feast. So she saw nothing of the comedy
enacting under her very eyelids: how, while she was led
out by my lord, Mr. Ogilvy made play with my lady; and
my lord, very much aware of it, fumed. The minute he
was dismissed, down he strode through the thick of the
frolic, maddening at the courtiers bowing about him, and
quarrelled and talked loud, and drank and talked louder;
but yet could not get near his handsome new wife. He
roundly told his brother-in-law at last that if her ladyship
would not come, he should go alone.</p>

<p>‘Whither, my lord?’ asks Huntly.</p>

<p>‘Why, to bed,’ says he.</p>

<p>‘It is yet early,’ says Huntly.</p>

<p>‘It is none so early for the bed I intend for,’ he was told.
‘My bed is at Hermitage. I am master there, I’d let you
know, and shall be here some day, God damn me.’ He was
in a high rage at the way things were going, and always
impatient of the least restraint. One or two bystanders,
however, shrewd men, suspected that he had met his match.</p>

<p>Lord Huntly did not believe him—could not believe
that he would ride, and ask his young Countess to ride,
fifty miles through the marriage night. Nevertheless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
towards six o’clock, the Earl came into the lower hall
with his great boots on and riding-cloak over his shoulder,
and confronted his lady standing with Mr. Ogilvy, my
Lord Livingstone, Mary Sempill, her Master, and some
more.</p>

<p>‘My lady,’ he said with a reverence, ‘I am a bird of the
bough. ’Tis after my hour—I’m for my bed.’</p>

<p>Lady Bothwell gave him a short look. ‘If that is your
night-gear, my lord, you sleep alone.’</p>

<p>Harshly he laughed. ‘It seems I am to do that. But,
mistress, when you want me you will find me at Hermitage,
whither I now go. And the same direction I give to you,
Mr. Ogilvy,’ says he with meaning. ‘If you come into my
country, or any country but this cursed town, you shall
find me ready for you, Mr. Ogilvy of Boyne.’</p>

<p>Ogilvy wagged his head. ‘La la la! We shall meet
again, never fear, my Lord Bothwell,’ says he.</p>

<p>The Countess gave him her hand to kiss. ‘I wish you
good-night, Boyne,’ she said: ‘I am going to my bed’:
then, looking her Earl in the face, ‘Pray you send your
page for my women, my lord. I lack my riding-gear.’</p>

<p>Lord Huntly, who was up with them by now, cries out:
‘What wild folly is this? Do you rave? You will never
go to Liddesdale this hell-black night! Are you mad,
Lord Bothwell, or a villain?’</p>

<p>‘I’m a bird of the bough, brother-in-law, a bird of the
bough.’</p>

<p>The Countess turned to her brother. ‘Should I be
afraid of the dark, Huntly, with this nobleman by my
side?’</p>

<p>‘God’s death, my child,’ says Bothwell, admiring her
cool blood, ‘I would be more at your side if you suffered
me.’</p>

<p>Lord Huntly turned on his heel.</p>

<p>She went to take leave of the Queen, and found her on
an unworthy arm. ‘My leave, madam. I crave liberty to
follow my lord.’</p>

<p>‘It should be the other way, child,’ said the Queen, ‘for
a little while, at least. But we will come and put you to
bed—and he shall come after.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Your Majesty’s pardon, but this may hardly be. My
lord chooses for Hermitage, and I must follow him—as
my duty is.’</p>

<p>It made the Queen grow red; but she did not let go the
arm she had. ‘As you will, mistress,’ she said stiffly, and
added something in Italian to her companion, who raised
his eyebrows and gave a little jerk of the head.</p>

<p>‘You ride a long way for your joy,’ she resumed, with
a hard ring in her voice. ‘It’s to be hoped you are well
accompanied. Yonder is a wild country: Turnbulls in the
Lammermuirs, Elliots in Liddesdale. But you have a wild
mate.’</p>

<p>The Countess then looked her full in the face. ‘Your
Majesty forgets,’ she said. ‘It is not men that I and mine
have reason to fear.’</p>

<p>After a short and quick recoil the Queen went straight
up to her and took her face in her two hands. Speaking
between clenched teeth, she said: ‘You shall not quarrel
with me, Jeannie Bothwell. Or I will not quarrel with
you. I wish you well wherever you go. Remember that:
and now give me a kiss.’</p>

<p>She had to take it, for it was not offered her; and then
she pushed the girl away with a little angry sob. ‘Ah,
how you hate me! You are the only woman in Scotland
that hates me.’ She felt the prick of tears, and shook her
head to be so fretted. ‘If I were to tell you of your Earl—as
I could if I cared——’ The Italian touched her arm,
and brought her sharply round. ‘Well? Why should I
not? Am I such a happy wife that my wedding-ring is a
gag? Shall she have of me the bravest man in Scotland,
and not know the price?’ Gulping down her anger, she
put her hand on her bosom to keep it quiet. ‘No, no, I
am not so base. Let her have what comfort she can. All
wives need that. God be with you, Jeannie Bothwell.’</p>

<p>‘And with your Majesty, at all times.’</p>

<p>The Countess curtsied, kissed hands, and went away
backwards. She had not taken the smallest notice of the
Italian.</p>

<p>‘If I could hate like that, David,’ said the Mistress, ‘I
should be Queen of France at this hour.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Oh, oh! And so you can, madam, and so you shall,’
replied the man.</p>

<p>The Queen sent for more lights, and drink for the
fiddlers. She did more. To please the French Ambassador
and his suite, she and her maids put on men’s
clothes, and flashed golden hangers from their belts before
the courtly circle. The dancing grew the looser as the
lights flared to their end. Many a man and many a maid
slept by the wall; but there was high revelry in the
midst.</p>

<p>Very late, the tumble and rioting at its top, in came
the King, with Lord Ruthven, Archie Douglas, and some
more of his friends. He stared, brushed his hot eyes.
‘What a witches’ Sabbath! Where’s my——? Where’s
the Queen?’</p>

<p>‘Yonder, sir. Masked, and talking with my Lady
Argyll—and——’</p>

<p>‘God help us, I see.’ He pushed squarely through the
crowd, and stood before her, not steadily.</p>

<p>‘Good-morrow to your Majesty,’ he said. ‘The hour
is late—or early, as you take it. But I am here—ready
for bed.’</p>

<p>She held her head up, looking away from him, and
spoke as if she were talking to her people.</p>

<p>‘I’ll not come,’ she said. ‘I am going to cards. Come,
ladies. Come, sirs.’ Turning, she left him.</p>

<p>He looked after her owlishly, blinking as if he was
about to cry. He caught Ruthven by the arm. ‘Oh,
man,’ he said, ‘oh, Ruthven, do you see that? Do you
see whom she has there?’</p>

<p>‘Hush, sir,’ says Ruthven. ‘’Tis the same as yesterday,
and all the yesterdays, and as many morrows as you
choose to stomach. Come you to your bed. You cannot
mend it this way.’</p>

<p>The King still blinked and looked after his wife. He
began to tremble. ‘Oh, man,’ he said, ‘when shall I
do it?’</p>

<p>Ruthven, after a flashing look at him, ran after the
Queen’s party. She was a little in front, cloaked now and
walking with her ladies. Ruthven caught up the Italian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
and said some words. The man stopped, and looked at
him guardedly. Ruthven came closer, and put his hand
on his shoulder, talking copiously. As he talked, and
went on talking, his hand slipped gently down the Italian’s
back to his middle, opened itself wide, and stayed there
open.</p>

<p>They parted with laughter on both sides, and a bow
from David. Ruthven came back.</p>

<p>‘You may do it when you please, sir,’ he said to the
King.</p>

<h3 id="II_CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="smaller">MANY DOGS</span></h3>

<p>When, on 6th March, the expected stroke fell upon my
Lord Chancellor Morton, and he was required to hand
over the seals of his high office to the Queen’s messengers,
he did so with a certain heavy dignity. As I imply, he
had had time for preparation. He had not seen his
sovereign for some weeks, knew that Lethington had not,
knew also that his alliance (even his kinship) with the
King had worked against him, and suspected finally,
that what that had not done for his prospects had been
managed by the Italian. So he bowed his head to Erskine
and Traquair when they waited upon him, and, pointing to
the Great Seal on the table, said simply, ‘Let her Majesty
take back what her Majesty gave. Gentlemen, good
night.’ Truly, we may say that nothing in his life became
him like the leaving it: but that is the rule.</p>

<p>The same evening—nine o’clock and a snowy night—Archie
Douglas came to his house in the Cowgate and
found him writing letters—not easily, but with grunts,
his tongue curling about his upper lip. The disgraced
Chancellor looked up, saw his cousin, and went on writing.
Archie waited. So presently, ‘<i>Moriturus te salutat</i>,’ says
the Earl, without ceasing to labour.</p>

<p>‘Pshaw, cousin,’ says Archie, ‘I have come to you with
a better cry nor that.’</p>

<p>‘Have you indeed?’ scoffed my lord. ‘Man, I would
be fain to know it.’</p>

<p>‘’Tis <i>Habet</i>,’ says Archie, ‘and down with your thumb.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>Lord Morton leaned back in his chair and raked his
beard with the pen’s end. The quip struck his fancy as a
pleasant one.</p>

<p>‘I take your meaning,’ he said. ‘I had thought of it
myself. But, to say nothing of his place by her side, I
doubt he wears a steel shirt.’</p>

<p>Archie said shortly: ‘He does not. The King felt him
last night as he sat at the cards. And Ruthven felt him
well on Bothwell’s marriage night.’</p>

<p>‘The King! He did that!’</p>

<p>‘He did just that.’</p>

<p>Morton gazed at him for a minute. ‘Why,’ he marvelled,
‘why, then he stands in wi’ the rest? Archie, are
ye very sure?’</p>

<p>Archie the wise snapped his fingers at such elementary
knowledge. ‘A month gone, come Friday, he began to
open to Ruthven about it.’</p>

<p>The Earl rapped the table smartly with his fingers.
‘And I am the last to know it! I thank you, cousin, for
your good conceit of me. By the mass, man, you treat
me like a boy.’</p>

<p>‘It’s no doing of mine,’ says Archie. ‘I was for making
you privy to it a week syne; but Ruthven, he said, “No.”
You were still Chancellor, d’ye see? And, says Ruthven,
your lordship was a tappit hen, that would sit till they
took the last egg from under ye.’</p>

<p>‘Damn his black tongue!’ growled my lord, and looked
at his letters. ‘But he’s in the right of it,’ he added.
‘Cold, cold is my nest the now.’</p>

<p>Archie moistened his lips. ‘They took the seals from
you this morn, cousin?’</p>

<p>‘It is not three hours since they had them.’</p>

<p>‘Do you guess what did it?’</p>

<p>Morton laughed shortly. ‘Ay! It was my Crown-Matrimonial,
I doubt.’</p>

<p>‘And do you guess who did it?’</p>

<p>He did not laugh now. ‘Have done with your idle
questioning. Who should do it but the fiddler?’</p>

<p>‘One more question,’ says Archie, ‘by your leave. Do
you guess who sits in your seat?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Ay, I think it, I think it. She will give it to one of
her familiars—her Huntly, or her fine Bothwell.’</p>

<p>Archie once more snapped his fingers. ‘Nor one, nor
t’other. There’s a man more familiar than the pair.
Cousin, the fiddler seals the briefs! The Italian is to be
Chancellor. Now what d’ye say?’</p>

<p>Lord Morton said nothing at all. He looked up, he
looked down; he screwed his hands together, rolled one
softly over the other.</p>

<p>Archie watched his heavy face grow darker as the tide
of rage crept up. Presently he tried to move him.</p>

<p>‘Are you for England, cousin?’ he asked.</p>

<p>‘Ay,’ said Morton, ‘that is my road.’</p>

<p>Archie then touched him on the shoulder. ‘Bide a
while, my lord. We shall all be friends here before many
days. Argyll is here.’</p>

<p>‘Argyll? The fine man!’</p>

<p>‘A finer follows him hard.’</p>

<p>‘Who then? Your sage Lethington?’</p>

<p>‘Lethington! Hoots! no; but the black Earl of
Moray, my good lord.’</p>

<p>The Earl of Morton stopped in the act of whistling.</p>

<p>‘Moray comes home?’</p>

<p>‘Ay. His forfeiture is set for the 12th. He is coming
home to meet it. All’s ready.’</p>

<p>Morton was greatly interested. To gain time he asked
an idle question. ‘Who has written him to come? Lethington?’</p>

<p>‘Ay, Michael Wylie.’</p>

<p>This was the name they gave him. Machiavelli may
be intended—if so, an injustice to each.</p>

<p>‘Who returns with my lord?’ Morton asked him next;
and Archie held up his fingers.</p>

<p>‘All of them that are now in England. Rothes, Pitarrow,
Grange—all of them. Stout men, cousin.’</p>

<p>Stout indeed! One of them had been enough for
Master Davy. My Lord Morton, his head sunk into his
portly chest, considered this news. Moray was an assurance—for
how did Moray strike? In the dark—quickly—when
no one was by. Well, then, if Moray were coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
to strike one’s enemy, why should one meddle? He was
never at his ease in that great man’s company, because he
could never be sure of his own aims while he doubted those
of his colleague. You could not tell—you never could tell—what
James Stuart intended. He would cut at one for
the sake of hitting another at a distance. If he were
coming back to cut at the Italian, for instance—at what
other did he hope to reach? Morton drove his slow wits
to work as he sat staring at his papers, trying vainly to
bottom the designs of a man whom he admired and distrusted
profoundly. Why so much force to scrag a wretched
Italian? The King, Archie, Moray, Grange, Pitarrow,
Argyll! And now himself, Morton! At whom was
Moray aiming? Was he entangling the King, whom he
hated? Could he be working against the Queen, his
sister? They used to say he coveted the throne. Could
this be his intent?</p>

<p>Such possibilities disturbed him. Let me do Lord
Morton the justice to say that his very grossness saved
him from any more curious villainy than a quick blow at
an enemy. The Italian had galled his dignity: damn the
dog! he would kill him for it. But to intend otherwise
than loyalty to the King, his kinsman—no, no! And as
for the Queen’s Majesty—why, she was a lass, and a pretty
lass too, though a wilful. She would never have stood in
his way but for that beastly foreign whisperer. Yet—if the
King had been dishonoured by the fiddler, and Moray
(knowing that) meant honestly ... Eh, sirs! So he
pondered in his dull, muddled way—his poor wits, like
yoked oxen, heavily plodding the fields of speculation,
turning furrow after furrow! Guess how he vexed the
nimble Archie.</p>

<p>‘Well, cousin, well?’ cries that youth at last: ‘I must
be going where my friends await me.’</p>

<p>‘Man,’ said Morton, and stopped him, ‘where are ye for?’</p>

<p>Archie replied: ‘Mum’s the word. But if you are the
man I believe you, you shall come along with me this
night.’</p>

<p>Morton had made up his mind. ‘I am with you—for
good or ill,’ he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>Cloaked and booted, the two kinsmen went out into the
dark. The wind had got up, bringing a scurry of dry
snow: they had to pull the door hard to get it home.</p>

<p>‘Rough work at sea the night,’ said Archie.</p>

<p>‘You’ll be brewing it rougher on land, I doubt,’ was
Lord Morton’s commentary.</p>

<p class="tb">In a little crow-stepped house by the shore of the Nor’
Loch the Earl of Morton was required to set his hand to
certain papers, upon which they showed him the names of
Argyll, Rothes, Ruthven, Archie Douglas, Lethington, and
others. He asked at once to see Lord Moray’s name:
they told him Lethington had it to a letter, which bound
him as fast as any bond.</p>

<p>‘It should be here,’ he said seriously.</p>

<p>But Ruthven cried out, How could it be there when his
lordship was over the Border?</p>

<p>Morton shook his head. ‘It should be here, gentlemen.
’Twere better to wait for it. What hurry is there?’</p>

<p>Ruthven said that the game was begun and ought to go
on now. ‘Judge you, my lord,’ he appealed, ‘if I should
put my head into a noose unless I held the cord in my
own hand.’</p>

<p>In his private mind Morton believed Ruthven a madman.
But he did not see how he could draw out now.</p>

<p>He read through the two papers—bands, they called
them. It was required of those who signed that they
should assist the King their sovereign lord to get the
Crown-Matrimonial—no harm in that!—and that they
should stand enemies to his enemies, friends to his friends.
On his side the King engaged to remove the forfeiture
from the exiled lords, to put back the Earl of Morton into
his office, and to establish the Protestant religion. Not a
word of the Italian, not a word of the Queen. The things
were well worded, evidently by Lethington.</p>

<p>‘When are we to be at it?’ he asked.</p>

<p>Ruthven told him, ‘Saturday coming, at night.’ It was
now Thursday.</p>

<p>‘How shall you deal?’ This was Morton again.</p>

<p>He was told, In the small hours of the night——and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
there he stopped them at once. ‘Oh, Ruthven! Oh,
Lindsay! Never on the Sabbath morn! Sirs, ye should
not——’</p>

<p>But Ruthven waved him off. The exact hour, he said,
must depend upon events. This, however, was the plan
proposed. When the Queen was set down to cards or a
late supper, Lord Morton with his men was to hold the
entry, doors, stairheads, passages, forecourt of the palace.
Traquair would be off duty, Erskine could be dealt with.
Bothwell, Huntly, Atholl, and all the rest of the Queen’s
friends would be abed; and Lindsay was to answer for
keeping them there. The King was to go into the Queen’s
closet and look over her shoulder at the game. At a
moment agreed upon he would lift up her chin, say certain
words, kiss her, and repeat the words. That was to be
the signal: then Ruthven, Archie Douglas, and Fawdonsyde—Ker
of Fawdonsyde, a notorious ruffian—would
do their work.</p>

<p>Morton listened to all this intently, with slow-travelling
eyes which followed the rafters from their spring in one
wall to their cobwebbed end in the other. He could find
no flaw at first, nor put his finger upon the damnable blot
there must be in it; but after a time, as he figured it over
and over, he missed somebody. ‘Stop there! stop there,
you Ruthven!’ he thundered. ‘Tell me this: Where will
Lethington be the while?’</p>

<p>He was told, ‘Gone to meet the Earl of Moray.’
Moray!—his jaw fell.</p>

<p>‘What! will Moray no be with me?’</p>

<p>They said, it was much hoped. But the roads were
heavy; there was a possibility——</p>

<p>He jeered at them. Did they not know Moray yet?
‘Man,’ he said, turning to Archie, ‘it’s not a possibility, it’s
as certain as the Day of Doom.’</p>

<p>Then they all talked at once. Moray’s name was fast to
a letter; the letter was fast in Lethington’s poke; Lethington
was fast to the band. What more could be done?
Would Lethington endanger his neck? His safety was
Moray’s, and theirs was Lethington’s. And the King?
What of the King?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>‘You talk of Doomsday, my lord!’ shouts Ruthven,
with the slaver of his rage upon his mouth: ‘there’s but one
doom impending, and we’ll see to it.’</p>

<p>Perorations had no effect upon Morton, who was still
bothered. He went over the whole again, clawing down
his fingers as he numbered the points. There was himself
to keep the palace, there was Lindsay to hold back
Bothwell; the King to go into the closet—the kiss—the
words of signal—then Ruthven and——Here he stopped,
and his eyes grew small.</p>

<p>‘Oh, sirs,’ he said, ‘the poor lassie! Sold with a kiss!
She’s big, sirs; you’ll likely kill mother and bairn.’</p>

<p>Ruthven, squinting fearfully, slammed the table.
‘Whose bairn, by the Lord? Tell me whose?’</p>

<p>Morton shook his head. ‘Yon’s hell-work,’ he said.
‘I’ll have nothing to do wi’t. I guess who’s had the
devising of it. ’Tis Lethington—a grey-faced thief.’</p>

<p>Here Archie Douglas, after looking to Ruthven, intervened,
and talked for nearly half an hour to his cousin.
Morton, very gloomy, heard him out; then made his own proposition.
He would stand by the King, he said; he would
hold the palace. No man should come in or out without
the password. But he would not go upstairs, nor know who
went up or what went on. This also he would have them
all promise before he touched the band with a pen:—Whatever
was done to the Italian should be done in the passage.
There should be no filthy butchery of a girl and her child,
either directly or by implication, where he had a hand at a
job. Such was his firm stipulation. Archie swore to
observe it; Fawdonsyde, Lindsay, swore; Ruthven said
nothing.</p>

<p>‘Archie,’ said his cousin, ‘go you and fetch me the
Scriptures. I shall fasten down Ruthven with the keys of
God.’ Ruthven put his hand upon the book and swore.
Then the Earl of Morton signed the band.</p>

<h3 id="II_CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="smaller">MIDNIGHT EXPERIENCES OF JEAN-MARIE-BAPTISTE DES-ESSARS</span></h3>

<p>On that appointed night of Saturday, the 9th of March—a
blowy, snowy night, harrowing for men at sea, with a mort
of vessels pitching at their cables in Leith Roads—Des-Essars
was late for his service. He should have come on
to the door at ten o’clock, and it wanted but two minutes
to that when he was beating down the Castle hill in the
teeth of the wind.</p>

<p>Never mind his errand, and expect fibs if you ask what
had kept him. Remember that he was older at this time
than when you first saw him, a French boy ‘with smut-rimmed
eyes,’ crop-headed, pale, shrewd, and reticent.
That was a matter of three years ago: the Queen was but
nineteen and he four years younger. He was eighteen now,
and may have had evening affairs like other people, no concern
of yours or mine. Whatever they may have been,
they had kept him unduly; he had two minutes and wanted
seven. He drew his bonnet close, his short cape about him,
and went scudding down the hill as fast as the snow would
let him in shoes dangerously thin for the weather, but useful
for tiptoe purposes. The snow had been heaped upon
the cawsey, but in the street trodden, thawed, and then
frozen again to a surface of ice. From it came enough
light to show that few people were abroad, and none lawfully,
and that otherwise it was infernally dark. A strangely
diffused, essential light it was, that of the snow. It put to
shame three dying candles left in the Luckenbooths and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
the sick flame of an oil lamp above the Netherbow Port.
After passing that, there was no sign of man or man’s comforts
until you were in the Abbey precincts.</p>

<p>Des-Essars knew—being as sharp as a needle—that
something was changed the moment he reached those
precincts; knew by the pricking of his skin, as they say.
A double guard set; knots of men-at-arms; some horses
led about; low voices talking in strange accents,—something
was altered. Worse than all this, he found the word
of the night unavailing: no manner of entry for him.</p>

<p>‘My service is the Queen’s, honourable sir,’ he pleaded
to an unknown sentry, who wore (he observed) a steel cap
of unusual shape.</p>

<p>The square hackbutter shook his head. ‘No way in this
night, Frenchman.’</p>

<p>‘By whose orders, if you please?’</p>

<p>‘By mine, Frenchman.’</p>

<p>Here was misfortune! No help for it, but he must brave
what he had hoped to avoid—his superior officer, to wit.</p>

<p>‘If it please you, sir,’ he said, ‘I will speak with Mr.
Erskine in the guardroom.’</p>

<p>‘Mr. Airrskin!’ was the shocking answer—and how
the man spoke it!—‘Mr. Airrskin! He’s no here. He’s
awa’. So now off with ye, Johnny Frenchman.’ The man
obviously had orders: but whose orders?</p>

<p>Des-Essars shrugged. He shivered also, as he always
did when refused anything—as if the world had proved
suddenly a chill place. But really the affair was serious.
Inside the house he must be, and that early. Driven to his
last resource, he walked back far enough for the dark to
swallow him up, returned upon his tracks a little way so
soon as the hackbutter had resumed his stamping up and
down; branched off to the right, slipping through a ruinous
stable, blown to pieces in former days by the English;
crossed a frozen cabbage garden which, having been flooded,
was now a sheet of cat-ice; and so came hard upon the
Abbey wall. In this wall, as he very well knew, there were
certain cavities, used as steps by the household when the
gateways were either not convenient or likely to be denied:
indeed, he would not, perhaps, have cared to reckon how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
many times he had used them himself. Having chipped
the ice out of them with his hanger, he was triumphantly
within the pale, hopping over the Queen’s privy garden
with high-lifted feet, like a dog in turnips. To win the
palace itself was easy. It was mighty little use having
friends in the kitchen if they could not do you services of
that kind.</p>

<p>He had to find the Queen, though, and face what she
might give him, but of that he had little fear. He knew
that she would be at cards, and too full of her troubles and
pains to seek for a new one. It is a queer reflection that he
makes in his Memoirs—that although he romantically loved
the Queen, he had no scruples about deceiving her and few
fears of being found out, so only that she did not take the
scrape to heart. ‘She was a goddess to me,’ he says, ‘in
those days, a remote point of my adoration. A young
man, however, is compact of two parts, an earthly and a
spiritual. If I had exhibited to her the frailties of my
earthly part it would have been by a very natural impulse.
However, I never did.’ This is a digression: he knew that
she would not fret herself about him and his affairs just
now, because she was ill, and miserable about the King.
Throwing a kiss of his hand, then, to the yawning scullery-wench,
who had had to get out of her bed to open the
window for him, he skimmed down the corridors on a light
foot, and reached the great hall. He hoped to go tiptoe up
the privy stair and gain the door of the cabinet without
being heard. When she came out she would find him
there, and all would be well. This was his plan.</p>

<p>It was almost dark in the hall, but not quite. A tree-bole
on the hearth was in the article of death; a few thin
flames about the shell of it showed him a company of men
in the corner by the privy stair. Vexatious! They were
leaning to the wall, some sitting against it; some were on
the steps asleep, their heads nodding to their knees. He
was cut off his sure access, and must go by the main staircase—if
he could. He tried it, sidling along by the farther
wall; but they spied him, two of them, and one went to cut
him off. A tall enemy this, for the little Frenchman; but
luckily for him it was a case of boots against no boots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
where silence was of the essence of the contract. Des-Essars,
his shoes in his hand, darted out into the open and
raced straight for the stair. The enemy began his pursuit—in
riding-boots. Heavens! the crash and clatter on the
flags, the echo from the roof! It would never do: hushed
voices called the man back; he went tender-footed, finally
stopped. By that time the page was up the stair, pausing
at the top to wipe his brows and neck of cold sweat, and
to wonder as he wiped what all this might mean. Double
guard in the court—strange voices—the word changed—Mr.
Erskine away! No sentry in the hall, but, instead, a
cluster of waiting, whispering men—in riding-boots—by
the privy stair! The vivacious young man was imaginative
to a fault; he could construct a whole tragedy of life and
death out of a change in the weather. And here was a
fateful climax to the tragedy of a stormy night! First,
the stress of the driving snow—whirling, solitary, forlorn
stuff!—the apprehension of wild work by every dark entry.
Passing the Tolbooth, a shriek out of the blackness had
sent his heart into his mouth. There had been fighting,
too, in Sim’s Close. He had seen a torch flare and dip,
men and women huddled about two on the ground; one
grunting, ‘Tak’ it! Tak’ it!’ and the other, with a strangled
wail, ‘Oh, Jesus!’ Bad hearing all this—evil preparation.
Atop of these apparitions, lo! their fulfilment: stroke after
stroke of doom. Cloaked men by the privy stair—<i>Dieu
de Dieu!</i> His heart was thumping at his ribs when he
peeped through the curtain of the Queen’s cabinet and
saw his mistress there with Lady Argyll and the Italian.
‘Blessed Mother!’ he thought, ‘here’s an escape for me.
I had no notion the hour was so late.’ What he meant
was, that the rest of the company had gone. He had
heard that Lord Robert Stuart and the Laird of Criech
were to sup that night. Well, they had supped and were
gone! It must be on the stroke of midnight.</p>

<p class="tb">The Queen, as he could see, lay back in her elbow-chair,
obviously suffering, picking at some food before her,
but not eating any. Her lips were chapped and dry; she
moistened them continually, then bit them. Lady Argyll,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
handsome, strong-featured, and swarthy, sat bolt upright
and stared at the sconce on the wall; and as for the
Italian, he did as he always did, lounged opposite his
Queen, his head against the wainscot. Reflective after
food, he used his toothpick, but no other ceremony whatsoever.
He wore his cap on his head, ignored Lady
Argyll—half-sister to the throne—and when he looked at
her Majesty, as he often did, it was as a man might look
at his wife. She, although she seemed too weary or too
indifferent to lift her heavy eyelids, knew perfectly well
that both her companions were watching her: Des-Essars
was sure of that. He watched her himself intensely, and
only once saw her meet Davy’s eye, when she passed her
cup to him to be filled with drink, and he, as if thankful
to be active, poured the wine with a flourish and smiled in
her face as he served her. She observed both act and
actor, and made no sign, neither drank from the cup now
she had it; but sank back to her wretchedness and the
contemplation of it, being in that pettish, brooding habit
of mind which would rather run on in a groove of pain
than brace itself to some new shift. As he watched what
was a familiar scene to him, Des-Essars was wondering
whether he should dare go in and report what he had
observed in the hall. No! on the whole he would not do
that. Signior Davy, who was a weasel in such a field as
a young man’s mind, would assuredly fasten upon him at
some false turn or other, never let go, and show no mercy.
Like all the underlings of Holyrood he went in mortal fear
of the Italian, though, unlike any of them, he admired
him.</p>

<p>The little cabinet was very dim. There were candles
on the table, but none alight in the sconces. From
beyond, through a half-open door, came the drowsy voices
of the Queen’s women, murmuring their way through two
more hours’ vigil. Interminable nights! Cards would
follow supper, you must know, and Signior Davy would
try to outsit Lady Argyll. He always tried, and generally
succeeded.</p>

<p>The Queen shifted, sighed, and played hasty tunes with
her fingers on the table: she was never still. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
evident that she was at once very wretched and very
irritable. Her dark-red gown was cut low and square,
Venetian mode: Des-Essars could see quite well how
short her breath was, and how quick. Yet she said
nothing. Once she and Lady Argyll exchanged glances;
the Mistress of the Robes inquired with her eyebrows, the
Queen fretfully shook the question away. It was an unhappy
supper for all but the graceless Italian, who was
much at his ease now that he had unfastened some of the
hooks of his jacket. The French lad, who had always
been in love with his mistress and yet able to criticise her—as
a Protestant may adore the Virgin Mary—admits
that at this moment of her life, in this bitter mood, he
found her extremely piquant. ‘This pale, helpless, angry,
pretty woman!’ he exclaims upon his page. He would
seldom allow that she was more than just a pretty woman;
and now she was a good deal less. Her charms for him
had never been of the face—she had an allure of her own.
‘Mistress Seton was lovely, I consider, my Lady Bothwell
most beautiful, and Mistress Fleming not far short of that:
but the Queen’s Majesty—ah! the coin from Mr. Knox’s
mint rang true. Honeypot! Honeypot! There you had
her essence: sleepy, slow, soft sweetness—with a sharp
aftertaste, for all that, to prick the tongue and set it
longing.’</p>

<p>More than nice considerations, these, which the stealthy
opening of a door and a step in the passage disturbed.
Des-Essars would have straightened himself on that signal,
to stand as a page should stand in the view of any one
entering. Then he saw, out of the corner of his eye, the
King go down the little stair. It must be the King,
because—to say nothing of the tall figure, small-headed as
it was,—he had seen the long white gown. The King
wore a white quilted-silk bedgown, lined with ermine. At
the turning of the stair Des-Essars saw him just glance
backwards over his shoulder towards the cabinet, but,
being stiff within the shadow of the curtain, was not
himself seen. After that furtive look he saw him go down
the privy stair, his hand on the rope. Obviously he had
an assignation with some woman below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>Before he had time to correct this conclusion by the
memory of the cloaked men in the hall, he heard returning
steps—somebody, this time, coming up the steps; no!
there were more than one—two or three at least. He was
sure of this—his ears had never deceived him—and yet it
was the King alone who appeared at the stair-head with a
lighted taper in his hand, which he must have got from
the hall. He stood there for a moment, his face showing
white and strained in the light, his mouth open, too; then,
blowing out his taper, he came directly to the curtain of
the Queen’s cabinet, pulled it aside and went in. He had
actually covered Des-Essars with the curtain without a
notion that he was there; but the youth had had time to
observe that he was fully dressed beneath his gown, and to
get a hot whiff of the strong waters in his breath as he
passed in. Urgent to see what all this might mean, he
peeped through the hangings.</p>

<p>Lady Argyll rose up slowly when she saw the King,
but made no reverence. Very few did in these days.
The Italian followed her example, perfectly composed.
The Queen took no notice of him. She rested as she had
been, her head on the droop, eyebrows raised, eyes fixed
on the disordered platter. The King, whose colour was
very high, came behind her chair, stooped, and put his arm
round her. His hand covered her bosom. She did not
avoid, though she did not relish this.</p>

<p>‘Madam, it is very late,’ he said, and spoke breathlessly.</p>

<p>‘It is not I who detain you,’ said she.</p>

<p>‘No, madam, no. But you do detain these good
servants of yours. Here is your sister of Argyll; next
door are your women. And so it is night after night. I
think not of myself.’</p>

<p>She lifted her head a little to look up sideways—but
not at him. ‘You think of very little else, to my understanding.
Having brought me to the state where now I
am, you are inclined to leave me alone. Rather, you
were inclined; for this is a new humour, little to my taste.’</p>

<p>‘I should be oftener here, believe me,’ says the King,
still embracing her, ‘if I could feel more sure of a welcome—if
all might be again as it was once between you and me.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>She laughed, without mirth; then asked, ‘And how
was it—once?’</p>

<p>The King stooped down and kissed her forehead, by the
same act gently pushing back her head till it rested on
his shoulder.</p>

<p>‘Thus it was once, my Mary,’ he said; and as she
looked up into his face, wondering over it, searching it,
he kissed her again. ‘Thus it was once,’ he repeated in
a louder voice; and then, louder yet, ‘Thus, O Queen
of Scots!’</p>

<p>Once more he kissed her, and once more cried out, ‘O
Queen of Scots!’ Then Des-Essars heard the footsteps
begin again on the privy stair, and saw men come into the
passage—many men.</p>

<p>Three of them, in cloaks and steel bonnets, came
quickly to the door, and passed him. They went through
the curtain. These three were Lord Ruthven, Ker of
Fawdonsyde, and Mr. Archibald Douglas. Rigid in his
shadow, Des-Essars watched all.</p>

<p>Seeing events in the Italian’s eyes, rather than with
her own—for Signior Davy had narrowed his to two
threads of blue—the Queen lifted her head from her
husband’s arm and looked curiously round. The three
stood hesitant within the door; Ruthven had his cap on
his head, Fawdonsyde his, but Archie showed his grey
poll. Little things like these angered her quickly; she
shook free from the King and sat upright.</p>

<p>‘What is this, my Lord Ruthven? You forget
yourself.’</p>

<p>‘Madam——’ he began; but Douglas nudged him
furiously.</p>

<p>‘Your bonnet, man, your bonnet!’</p>

<p>The Queen had risen, and the fixed direction of her
eyes gave him understanding.</p>

<p>‘Ah, my knapscall! I do as others do, madam,’ he
said, with a meaning look at the Italian. ‘What is
pleasant to your Majesty in yonder servant should not
be an offence in a councillor.’</p>

<p>‘No, no, ma’am, nor it should not,’ muttered Fawdonsyde,
who, nevertheless, doffed his bonnet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>The King was holding her again, she staring still at
the scowling man in steel. ‘What do you want with me,
Ruthven?’ she said. She had very dry lips.</p>

<p>He made a clumsy bow. ‘May it please your Majesty,’
he said, ‘we are come to rid you of this fellow Davy, who
has been overlong familiar here, and overmuch—for your
Majesty’s honour.’</p>

<p>She turned her face to the King, whose arm still held
her—a white, strong face.</p>

<p>‘You,’ she said fiercely, ‘what have you to do in this?
What have you to say?’</p>

<p>‘I think with Ruthven—with all of them—my friends
and well-wishers. ’Tis the common voice: they say I am
betrayed, upon my soul! I cannot endure—I entreat you
to trust me——’ He was incoherent.</p>

<p>She broke away from his arm, took a step forward and
put herself between him and the three. She was so angry
that she could not find words. She stammered, began to
speak, rejected what words came. The Italian took off
his cap and watched Ruthven intently. The moment of
pause that ensued was broken by Ruthven’s raising his
hand, for the Queen flashed out, ‘Put down your hand,
sir!’ and seemed as if she would have struck him. Fawdonsyde
here cocked his pistol and deliberately raised it
against the Queen’s person. ‘Treason! treason!’ shrieked
Des-Essars from the curtain, and blundered forward to the
villain.</p>

<p>But the Queen had been before him; at last she had
found words, and deeds. She drew herself up, quivering,
went directly towards Fawdonsyde, and beat down the
point of the pistol with her flat hand. ‘Do you dare so
much? Then I dare more. What shameless thing do
you here? If I had a sword in my hand——’ Here she
stopped, tongue-tied at what was done to her.</p>

<p>For Ruthven, regardless of majesty, had got her round
the middle. He pushed her back into the King’s arms;
and, ‘Take your wife, my lord,’ says he; ‘take your good-wife
in your arms and cherish her, while we do what must
be done.’</p>

<p>The King held her fast in spite of her struggles. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
that moment the Italian made a rattling sound in his
throat and backed from the table. Archie Douglas
stepped behind the King, to get round the little room;
Ruthven approached his victim from the other side; the
Italian pulled at the table, got it between himself and the
enemy, and overset it: then Lady Argyll screamed, and
snatched at a candlestick as all went down. It was the
only light left in the room, held up in her hand like a
beacon above a tossing sea. Where was Des-Essars?
Cuffed aside to the wall, like a rag doll. The maids were
packed in the door of the bedchamber, and one of them
had pulled him into safety among them.</p>

<p>All that followed he marked: how the frenzied Italian,
hedged in between Douglas and Ruthven, vaulted the
table, knocked over Fawdonsyde, and then, whimpering
like a woman, crouched by the Queen, his fingers in the
pleats of her gown. He saw the King’s light eyelashes
blink, and heard his breath come whistling through his
nose; and that pale, disfigured girl, held up closely against
her husband, moaning and hiding her face in his breast.
And now Ruthven, grinning horribly, swearing to himself,
and Douglas, whining like a dog at a rat-hole, were at
their man’s hands, trying to drag him off. Fawdonsyde
hovered about, hopeful to help. Lady Argyll held up the
candle.</p>

<p>Douglas wrenched open one hand, Ruthven got his
head down and bit the other till it parted.</p>

<p>‘<i>O Dio! O Dio!</i>’ long shuddering cries went up from
the Italian as they dragged him out into the passage,
where the others waited.</p>

<p>It was dark there, and one knew not how full of men;
but Des-Essars heard them snarling and mauling like a
pack of wolves; heard the scuffling, the panting, the short
oaths—and then a piercing scream. At that there was
silence; then some one said, as he struck, ‘There! there!
Hog of Turin!’ and another (Lindsay), ‘He’s done.’</p>

<p>The King put the Queen among her maids in a hurry,
and went running out into the passage as they were
shuffling the body down the stair. Des-Essars just
noticed, and remembered afterwards, his naked dagger in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
his hand as he went out helter-skelter after his friends.
Upon some instinct or other, he followed him as far as the
head of the stair. From the bottom came up a great
clamour—howls of execration, one or two cries for the
King, a round of welcome when he appeared. The page
ran back to the cabinet, and found it dark.</p>

<p>It was bad to hear the Queen’s laughter in the bedchamber—worse
when that shuddered out into moaning,
and she began to wail as if she were keening her dead.
He could not bear it, so crept out again to spy about the
passages and listen to the shouting from the hall. ‘A
Douglas! a Douglas!’ was the most common cry. Peeping
through a window which gave on to the front, he saw
the snowy court ablaze with torches, alive with men, and
against the glare the snowflakes whirling by, like smuts
from a burning chimney. It was clear enough now that
the palace was held, all its inmates prisoners. But what
seemed more terrifying than that was the emptiness of the
upper corridors, the sudden hush after so much riot—and
the Queen’s moan, haunting all the dark like a lost soul.</p>

<p class="tb">It was so bad up there that the lad, his brain on fire,
felt the need of any company—even that of gaolers. No
one hindering, he crept down the privy stair,—horribly
slippery it was, and he knew why,—hoping to spy into the
hall; and this also he was free to do, since the stair-foot
was now unguarded. He found the hall crowded with
men; great torches smoking to the rafters; a glow of light
on shields and blazonry, the banners and achievements of
dead kings. In the stir of business the arras surged like
the waves of the sea. A furious draught blew in from the
open doors, to which all faces were turned. Men craned
over each others’ backs to look there. Des-Essars could
not see the King; but there at the entry was the Earl of
Morton in his armour, two linkmen by him. He was reading
from a bill: in front of him was a clear way; across
it stood the Masters of Lindsay and Ruthven, and men in
their liveries, halberds in their hands.</p>

<p>‘Pass out, Earl of Atholl,’ he heard Lord Morton say;
‘Pass out, Lord of Tullibardine’: and then, after a while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
of looking and pointing, he saw the grizzled head and
square shoulders of my Lord Atholl moving down the lane
of men, young Tullibardine uncovered beside him.</p>

<p>‘Pass out, Pitcur; pass out, Mr. James Balfour; pass
out, the Lord Herries.’ The same elbowing in the crowd:
three men file out into the scurrying snow—all the Queen’s
friends, observe.</p>

<p>Near to Des-Essars a man asked of his neighbour,
‘Will they let by my Lord Huntly, think you?’</p>

<p>The other shook his head. ‘Never! He’ll keep company
with the Reiver of Liddesdale, be sure.’</p>

<p>The Reiver was Lord Bothwell, of course, whom Des-Essars
knew to be in the house. ‘Good fellow-prisoners
for us,’ he thought.</p>

<p>‘Pass out, Mr. Secretary, on a fair errand.’</p>

<p>There was some murmuring at this; but the man went
out unmolested, with a sweep of the bonnet to my Lord
Morton as he passed. Des-Essars saw him stop at the
first taste of the weather and cover his mouth with his
cloak—but he waited for no more. A thought had struck
him. He slipped back up the puddled stair, gained the
first corridor, and, knowing his way by heart, went in and
out of the passages until he came to a barred door. Here
he put his ear to the crack and listened intently.</p>

<p>For a long time he could hear nothing on either side
the door; but by and by somebody with a light—a man—came
to the farther end of the passage and looked about,
raising and dipping his lantern. That was an ugly
moment! Crouched against the wall, he saw the lamp
now high now low, and marked with a leaping heart how
nearly the beams reached to where he lay. He heard a
movement behind the door, too, but had to let it go. Not
for full three minutes after the disappearance of the
watchman did he dare put his knuckles to the door,
and tap, very softly, at the panel. He tapped and tapped.
A board creaked; there was breathing at the door. A
voice, shamming boldness, cried, ‘Qui est?’</p>

<p>Des-Essars smiled. ‘C’est toi, Paris?’</p>

<p>His question was answered by another. ‘Tiens, qui est
ce drôle?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>Paris, for a thousand pound! Knocking again, he
declared himself. ‘It is I, Paris—M. Des-Essars.’</p>

<p>‘Monsieur Baptiste, your servant,’ then said Paris
through the door.</p>

<p>‘My lord is a prisoner, Paris?’</p>

<p>‘Not for the first time, my dear sir.’</p>

<p>‘How many are you there?’</p>

<p>‘Four. My lord, and Monsieur de Huntly, myself,
Jock Gordon.’</p>

<p>‘Well, you should get out—but quickly, before they
have finished in the hall. They are passing men out. Be
quick, Paris—tell my lord.’</p>

<p>‘Bravo!’ says Paris. ‘We should get out—and quickly!
By the chimney, sir? There is no chimney. By the
window? There is but one death for every man, and one
neck to be broke.’</p>

<p>‘You will break no necks at all, you fool. Below these
windows is the lions’ house.’</p>

<p>Paris thought. ‘Are you sure of that?’</p>

<p>‘Sure! Oh, Paris, make haste!’</p>

<p>Again Paris appeared to reflect; and then he said, ‘If
you are betraying a countryman of yours, M. Des-Essars,
and your old patron also, you shall never see God.’</p>

<p>Des-Essars wrung his hands. ‘You fool! you fool!
Are you mad? Call my lord.’</p>

<p>‘Wait,’ said Paris. In a short time, the sound of heavy
steps. Ah, here was my lord!</p>

<p>‘’Tis yourself, Baptist?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, yes, my lord.’</p>

<p>‘Have they finished with Davy?’</p>

<p>‘My God, sir!’</p>

<p>‘What of the Queen?’</p>

<p>‘Her women have her.’</p>

<p>‘Now, Baptist. You say the lion-house is below these
windows. Which windows? There are four.’</p>

<p>‘The two in the midst, my lord. My lord, across the
Little Garden—in a straight line—there are holes in the
wall.’</p>

<p>‘Oho! You are a brave lad. Go to your bed.’</p>

<p>Jean-Marie-Baptiste Des-Essars went back to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
Queen’s side. At the door of the cabinet he found Adam
Gordon in a fit of sobs. ‘Oh, my fine man,’ says the
French lad, stirring him with his foot, ‘leave tears to the
women. This is men’s business.’</p>

<p>Adam lifted up his stricken face. ‘Where have you
been cowering, traitor?’</p>

<p>Jean-Marie laughed grimly. ‘I have been saving
Scotland,’ he said, ‘whilst you were blubbering here.’</p>

<p>Adam Gordon, being up by now, knocked Jean-Marie
down.</p>

<p>‘I excused him readily, however,’ he writes in his
Memoirs, ‘considering the agitation we all suffered at the
time. And where he felled me there I lay, and slept like
a child.’</p>

<h3 id="II_CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="smaller">VENUS IN THE TOILS</span></h3>

<p>Sir James Melvill, whom readers must remember at
Saint Andrews as a shrewd, elderly courtier, expert in
diplomacy and not otherwise without humours of a dry sort,
plumed himself upon habit—‘Dear Mother Use-and-Wont,’
as he used to say. A man is sane at thirty, rich at forty,
wise at fifty, or never; and what health exacts, wealth
secures, and wisdom requires, is the orderly, punctual
performance of the customary. You may have him now
putting his theory into severest practice: for though he had
seen what was to be seen during that night of murder and
alarm, though he had lain down to sleep in his cloak no
earlier than five o’clock in the small hours, by seven, which was
his Sunday time, he was up and about, stamping his booted
feet to get the blood down, flacking his arms, and talking
encouragement to himself—as, ‘Hey, my bonny man, how’s
a’ with you the morn?’ Very soon after you might have seen
him over the ashes of the fire, raking for red embers and
blowing some life into them with his frosted breath. All
about lay his snoring fellows, though it was too dark to see
them. Every man lay that night where he could find his
length, and slept like the dead in their graves. There
seemed no soul left in a body but in his own.</p>

<p>He went presently to the doors, thinking to open them
unhindered. But no! a sitting sentry barred the way with
a halberd. ‘May one not look at the weather, my fine
young man?’ says Sir James.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>‘’Tis as foul as the grave, master, and a black black frost.
No way out the now.’</p>

<p>Sir James, who intended to get out, threw his cloak over
his shoulder and gravely paced the hall until the chances
should mend. One has not warred with the Margrave,
held a hand at cards with the Emperor Charles at Innspruck,
loitered at Greenwich in attendance upon Queen
Elizabeth, or endured the King of France in one of his
foaming rages, without learning patience. He proposed
to walk steadily up and down the hall until nine o’clock.
Then he would get out.</p>

<p class="tb">The women said afterwards that the Queen had quieted
down very soon, dried her eyes, gone to bed, and slept
almost immediately ‘as calm as a babe new-born.’ However
that may be, she awoke as early as Sir James, and,
finding herself in Mary Fleming’s arms, awoke her too in
her ordinary manner by biting her shoulder, not hard. ‘My
lamb, my lamb!’ cooed the maid; but the Queen in a
brisk voice said, ‘What’s o’clock?’ The lamp showed it
to be gone seven.</p>

<p>The Queen said: ‘Get up, child, and find me the page
who was in the cabinet last night. I saw him try the entry,
and he ran in when—when.... It was Baptist, I think.’</p>

<p>She spoke in an even voice, as if the occasion had
been a card party. This frightened Mary Fleming, who
began to quiver, and to say, ‘Oh, ma’am, did Baptist see
all? ’Twill have scared away his wits.’ And then she
tried coaxing. ‘Nay, <i>ma Reinette</i>, but you must rest
awhile. Come, let me stroke your cheek’—a common
way with them of inviting sleep to her.</p>

<p>But the Queen said, ‘I have had too much stroking—too
much. Now do as I bid you.’ So the maid clothed
herself in haste and went out with a lamp.</p>

<p>Outside the door she found the two youths asleep—Des-Essars
on the floor, Gordon by the table—and
awoke them both. ‘Which of you was on the door last
night?’</p>

<p>‘It was I, Mistress Fleming,’ said the foreigner. ‘All
the time I was there.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Come with me, then. You are sent for.’</p>

<p>He followed her in high excitement into the Queen’s
bedchamber. There he saw Margaret Carwood asleep on
her back, lying on the floor; and the Queen propped up
with pillows, a white silk shift upon her—or half upon her,
for one shoulder was out of it. She looked sharper, more
like Circe, than she had done since her discomforts began:
very intense, very pale, very black in the eyes. And she
smiled at him in a curiously secret way—a beckoning,
fluttering of the lips, as if she shared intelligence with
him, and told him so by signs. ‘She was as sharp and
hard and bright as a cut diamond,’ he writes of this
appearance; ‘nor do I suppose that any lady in the storied
world could have turned her face away from a night of
terror and blood, towards a day-to-come of insult, chains
and degradation, as she turned hers now before my very
eyes.’</p>

<p>She did not say anything for a while, but considered
him absorbingly, with those fever-bright eyes and that
cautious smile, until she had made up her mind. He, of
course, was down on his knee; Mary Fleming, beside
him, stood—her hand just touching his shoulder.</p>

<p>‘Come hither, Jean-Marie.’</p>

<p>Approaching, he knelt by the bed.</p>

<p>‘No,’ said she, ‘stand up—closer. Now give me your
hand.’</p>

<p>He held it out, and she took it in her own, and put it
against her side. He simply gazed at her in wonder.</p>

<p>‘Tell me now if you feel my heart beating.’</p>

<p>He waited. ‘No, madam,’ said he then, whispering.</p>

<p>‘Think again.’</p>

<p>He did. ‘No, madam. Ah! pardon. Yes, I feel it.’</p>

<p>‘That will do.’</p>

<p>He whipped back his hand and put it behind him. It
had been the right hand. The Queen watched all, still
smiling in that wise new way of hers.</p>

<p>‘Now,’ she said, ‘I think you will serve me, since
you have assured yourself that I am not so disturbed as
you are. I wish you to find out where they have put
him.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>He felt Mary Fleming start and catch at her breath; but
to him the question seemed very natural.</p>

<p>‘I will go now, madam.’</p>

<p>‘Yes. Go now. Be secret and speedy, and come back
to me.’</p>

<p>He bowed, rose up, and went tiptoe out of that
chamber of mystery and sharp sweetness. Just beyond
the door Adam Gordon pounced on him and caught him
by the neck. He struggled fiercely, tried to bite.</p>

<p>‘Let me go, let me go, you silly fool, and worse! I’m
on service. Oh, my God, let me go!’</p>

<p>‘How does she? Speak it, you French thief.’</p>

<p>‘<i>Dieu de Dieu!</i>’ he panted, ‘I shall stab you.’</p>

<p>At once his hands were pinned to the wall, and he
crucified. He told his errand—since time was all in all—with
tears of rage.</p>

<p>‘I shall go with you,’ says Adam. ‘We will go together.’</p>

<p>In the entry of the Chapel Royal, near the kings’
tombs, they found what seemed to be a new grave. A
loose flagstone—scatter of gravel all about—the stone not
level: one end, in fact, projected its whole thickness above
the floor.</p>

<p>‘There he lies,’ says Adam. ‘What more do you
want?’</p>

<p>Des-Essars was tugging at the stone. ‘It moves, it
moves!’ He was crimson in the face.</p>

<p>They both tussled together: it gave to this extent, that
they got the lower edge clear of the floor.</p>

<p>‘Hold on! Keep it so!’ snapped Des-Essars suddenly.</p>

<p>He dropped on to his stomach and thrust his arm into
the crack, up to the elbow.</p>

<p>‘What are you at? Be sharp, man, or I shall drop it!’
cried Adam in distress.</p>

<p>He <i>was</i> sharp. In a moment he had withdrawn his
hand, jumped up and away, and was pelting to the stairs.
Adam let the great stone down with a thud and was after
him. He was stopped at the Queen’s door by a maid—Seton.</p>

<p>‘Less haste, Mr. Adam. You cannot enter. Her
Majesty is busy.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>Des-Essars had found the Queen waiting for him—nobody
else in the room.</p>

<p>‘Well? You saw it?’</p>

<p>‘I have seen a grave, madam.’</p>

<p>‘Well?’</p>

<p>‘It is a new grave.’</p>

<p>‘There’s nothing in that, boy.’</p>

<p>‘Monsieur David is in there, ma’am.’</p>

<p>Her quick eyes narrowed. How she peered at him!
‘How do you know?’</p>

<p>‘Madam, I lifted up the stone. No one was about.’</p>

<p>‘Well?’</p>

<p>‘I found something under it. I have it. I am therefore
quite sure.’</p>

<p>‘What did you find? Let me see it.’</p>

<p>He plucked out of his breast a glittering thing and laid
it on the bed.</p>

<p>‘Behold it, madam!’ Folding his arms, he watched it
where it lay.</p>

<p>The Queen stared down at a naked dagger. A longish,
lean, fluted blade; and upon the bevelled edge a thick
smear, half its length.</p>

<p>She did not touch it, but moved her lips as if she were
talking to it. ‘Do I know you, dagger? Have we been
friends, dagger, old friends—and now you play me a trick?’
She turned to Des-Essars. ‘You know that dagger?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, ma’am.’ He had seen it often, and no later than
last night, and then in hand.</p>

<p>‘That will do,’ said she. ‘Leave me now. Send
Fleming and Seton—and Carwood also. I shall rise.’</p>

<p>When he was gone her face changed—grew softer, more
thoughtful. Now she held out her hand daintily, the little
finger high above the others, and with the tips of two
daintily touched the dagger. She was rather horrible—like
a creature of the woods at night, an elf or a young
witch, playing with a corpse. She laughed quietly to
herself as she fingered the stained witness of so much
terror; but then, when she heard them at the door, picked
it up by the handle and put it under the bedclothes. No
one was to know what she meant to do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>The women came in. ‘Dress me, Carwood, and quickly.
Dolet, have you my bath ready?’ ‘Mais, c’est sûr, Majesté.’
They poured out for her a bath of hot red wine. No day
of her life passed but she dipped herself in that.</p>

<p class="tb">At nine o’clock, braced into fine fettle by his exercise,
Sir James Melvill went again to the hall doors. A few
shiverers were about by this time, for sluggard dawn was
gaping at the windows; some knelt by the fire which his
forethought had saved for them, some hugged themselves
in corners; one man was praying aloud in an outlandish
tongue, praying deeply and striking his forehead with his
palm. Sir James, not to be deterred by prayers or spies,
stepped up to the sentry, a new man, and tapped him on
the breast. ‘Now, my honest friend,’ he said pleasantly,
‘I have waited my two hours, and am prepared to wait
other two. But he to whom my pressing errand is must
wait no longer. I speak of my lord of Morton—your
master and mine, as things have turned out.’</p>

<p>‘My lord will be here by the ten o’clock, sir,’ says the
man.</p>

<p>‘I had promised him exact tidings by eight,’ replied Sir
James; and spoke so serenely that he was allowed to pass
the doors, which were shut upon him. Nobody could have
regretted more than himself that he had lied: he had no
mortal errand to the Earl of Morton. But seeing that he
had not failed of Sabbath sermon for a matter of fifteen
years, it was not to be expected that the murder of an
Italian was to stay him now. Sermon in Saint Giles’s was
at nine. He was late.</p>

<p>The fates were adverse: there was to be no sermon for
him that Sabbath. As he walked gingerly across the
Outer Close—a staid, respectable, Sunday gentleman—he
heard a casement open behind him, and turning sharply
saw the Queen at her chamber window, dressed in grey
with a white ruff, and holding a kerchief against her neck.
After a hasty glance about, which revealed no prying eyes,
he made a low reverence to her Majesty.</p>

<p>Sparkling and eager as she looked, she nodded her head
and leaned far out of the window. ‘Sir James Melvill,’ she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
called down, in a clear, carrying voice, ‘you shall do me a
service if you please.’</p>

<p>‘God save your Majesty, and I do please,’ says Sir
James.</p>

<p>‘Then help me from this prison where now I am,’ she
said. ‘Go presently to the Provost, bid him convene the
town and come to my rescue. Go presently, I say; but
run fast, good sir, for they will stay you if they can.’</p>

<p>‘Madam, with my best will and legs.’ He saluted, and
walked briskly on over the frozen snow.</p>

<p>Out of doors after him came a long-legged man in black,
a chain about his neck, a staff in hand; following him, three
or four lacqueys in a dark livery.</p>

<p>‘Ho, Sir James Melvill! Ho, Sir James!’</p>

<p>He was by this time at the Outer Bailey, which stood
open for him—three paces more and he had done it. But
there were a few archers lounging about the door of the
Guard House, and two who crossed and recrossed each
other before the gates. ‘Gently doth it,’ quoth he, and
stayed to answer his name to the long-legged Chamberlain.</p>

<p>‘What would you, Mr. Wishart, sir?’</p>

<p>‘Sir James, my lord of Ruthven hath required me——’
But he got no further.</p>

<p>‘Your lord of Ruthven?’ cried Sir James. ‘Hath he
required you to require of me, Mr. Wishart?’</p>

<p>‘Why, yes, sir. My lord would be pleased to know
whither you are bound so fast. He is, sir, in a manner of
speaking, deputy to the King’s Majesty at this time.’</p>

<p>Sir James blinked. He could see the Queen behind
her window, watching him. ‘I am bound, sir,’ he said
deliberately, ‘whither I shall hope to see my lord of
Ruthven tending anon. The sermon, Mr. Wishart, the
sermon calls me; the which I have not foregone these
fifteen years, nor will not to-day unless you and your
requirements keep me unduly.’</p>

<p>‘I told my lord you would be for the preaching, Sir
James. I was sure o’t. But he’s a canny nobleman, ye
ken; and the King’s business is before a’.’</p>

<p>‘I have never heard, Mr. Wishart, that it was before that
of the King of kings,’ said Sir James.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Ou, fie, Sir James! To think that I should say so!’—Mr.
Wishart was really concerned—‘Nor my lord neither,
whose acceptance of the rock of doctrine is well known. I
shall just pop in and inform my lord.’</p>

<p>‘Do so. And I wish you a good day, Mr. Wishart,’
says Sir James in a stately manner, and struck out of the
gates and up the hill.</p>

<p>He went directly to the Provost’s house, and what he
learned there seemed to him so serious, that he overstepped
his commission by a little way. ‘Mr. Provost,’ he said,
‘you tell me that you have orders from the King. I
counsel you to disregard them. I counsel you to serve
and obey your sanctified anointed Queen. The King, Mr.
Provost, is her Majesty’s right hand, not a doubt of it; but
when the right hand knoweth not what the left hand is
about, it is safer to wait until the pair are in agreement
again. What the King may have done yesterday he may
not do to-day—he may not wish it, or he may not be
capable of it. I am a simple gentleman, Mr. Provost, and
you are a high officer, steward of this good town. I counsel
not the officer in you, but the sober burgess, when I repeat
that what may have been open to the King yesterday may
be shut against him to-day.’</p>

<p>‘Good guide us, Sir James, this is dangerous work!’
cried the Provost. ‘Who’s your informant in the matter?’</p>

<p>‘I have told you that I am a simple gentleman,’ said
Sir James, ‘but I lied to you. I am a Queen’s messenger:
I go from you to meet her Majesty’s dearest brother, the
good Earl of Moray, who should be home to-day.’</p>

<p>It must be owned that, if he was an unwilling liar, he
was a good one. He lied like truth, and the stroke was
masterly. The Provost set about convening the town;
and when Sir James Melvill walked back to Holyrood—after
sermon—all the gates were held in the Queen’s
name.</p>

<p>He did not see her, for the King was with her at the
time; but Mary Beaton received him, heard his news and
reported it. She returned shortly with a message: ‘The
Queen’s thanks to Sir James Melvill. Let him ride the
English road and meet the Earl of Moray by her Majesty’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
desire.’ He was pleased with the errand, proud to serve
the Queen. His greatest satisfaction, however, was to
reflect that he had not, after all, lied to the Provost of
Edinburgh.</p>

<p class="tb">Now we go back to Queen Mary. Bathed and powdered,
dressed and coifed, her head full of schemes and heart high
in courage, she waited for the King, being very sure in
her own mind that he would come if she made no sign.
Certainly, certainly he would come: she had reasoned it
all out as she lay half in bed, smiling and whispering to
the dagger. ‘He has been talked into this, by whom I
am not sure, but I think by Ruthven and his friends.
They will never stop where now they are, but will urge
him further than he cares to go. I believe he will wait to
see what I do. He is not bold by nature, but by surges of
heat which drive him. Fast they drive him—yet they leave
him soon! When he held me last night he was trembling—I
felt him shake. And yet—he has strong arms, and the
savour of a man is upon him!’</p>

<p>She sat up, with her hands to clasp her knee, and let
her thought go galloping through the wild business. ‘I
felt the child leap as I lay on his breast! Did he urge
towards the King his father, glad of his manhood? So,
once upon a day, urged I towards the King my lord!’</p>

<p>She began to blush, but would be honest with herself.
‘And if he came again to me now, and took me so again
in his arms—and again I sensed the man in him—what
should I do?’</p>

<p>She looked wise, as she smiled to feel her eyes grow
dim. But then she shook her head. ‘He will come, he
will come—but not so. I know him: oh, I know him like
a thumbed old book! And when I bring out that which
I have here’—her hand caressed the dagger—‘I know
what he will do. Yes, yes, like an old book! He will rail
against his betrayer, and in turn betray him. Ah, my
King, my King, do I read you aright? We shall see very
soon.’</p>

<p>She looked out upon the snowy close, the black walls
and dun pall of air; she saw Sir James Melvill set forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
upon his pious errand, and changed it, as you know. Then
she resumed her judging and weighing of men.</p>

<p>Odd! She gave no thought to the wretched Italian,
her mind was upon the quick, and not the dead. Ruthven,
a black, dangerous man—scolding-tongued, impious in
mind, thinking in oaths—yes: but a man! Archie Douglas,
supple as a snake, Fawdonsyde and his foolish pistols, she
considered not at all; but her mind harped upon Ruthven
and the King, who had each laid rough hands upon her—and
thus, it seems, earned her approbation. Ruthven had
taken her about the middle and pushed her back, helpless,
into the other’s arms; and she had felt those taut arms,
and not struggled; but leaned there, her face in his doublet.
<i>Pardieu</i>, each had played the man that night! And Ruthven
would play it again, and the King would not. No, no;
not he!</p>

<p>Ruthven, by rights, should be won over. Should she
try him? No, he would refuse her; she was sure of it.
He was as bluff, as flinty-cored as——Ranging here and
there, searching Scotland for his parallel, her heart jumped
as she found him. Bothwell, Bothwell! Ha, if he had
been there! It all began to re-enact itself—the scuffling,
grunting, squealing business, with Bothwell’s broad shoulders
steady in the midst of it. Man against man: Bothwell
and Ruthven face to face, and the daggers agleam in the
candle-light:—hey, how she saw it all doing! Ruthven
would stoop and glide by the wall: his bent knees, his
mad, twitching brows! Bothwell would stand his ground
in mid-floor, and his little eyes would twinkle. ‘Play fairly
with the candle, my Lady Argyll!’ and he would laugh—yes,
she could hear his ‘Ho, ho, ho!’ But she jumped up
as she came to that, she panted and felt her cheeks burn.
She held her fine throat with both hands until she had
calmed herself. So doing, a thought struck her. She
rang her hand-bell and sent for Des-Essars once more.</p>

<p>When he came to her she made a fuss over him, stroked
his hair, put her hand on his shoulder, said he was her
young knight who should ride out to her rescue. He was
to take a message from her to the Earl of Bothwell—that
he was on no account to stir out of town until he heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
from her again. He should rather get in touch with all of
her friends and be ready for instant affairs. Des-Essars
went eagerly but discreetly to work. She then had just
time to leave a direction for Melvill, that he should be first
with her brother Moray, when they told her that the King
was coming in.</p>

<p>‘Of course he is coming,’ she said. ‘What else can he
do?’</p>

<p>Her courage rose to meet him more than half-way. If
Des-Essars had been allowed to feel her heart again he
would have found it as steady as a man’s.</p>

<p>‘I will see the King in the red closet,’ she said. ‘Seton,
Fleming, come you with me.’</p>

<p>When he was announced he found her thus in company,
sitting at her needlework on a low coffer by the
window.</p>

<p>The young man had thickened rims to his eyes, but else
looked pinched and drawn. He kept a napkin in his hand,
with which he was for ever dabbing his mouth: seeming
to search for signs of blood upon it, he inspected it curiously
whenever it had touched him. As he entered the Queen
glanced up, bowed her head to him and resumed her stitch-work.
The two maids, after their curtseys, remained
standing—to his visible perturbation. It was plain that he
had expected to find her alone; also that he had strung
himself up for a momentous interview—and that she had
not. He grew more and more nervous, the napkin hovered
incessantly near his mouth; half-turning to call his man
Standen into the room, he thought better of it, and
came on a little way, saying, ‘Madam, how does your
Majesty?’</p>

<p>She looked amused at the question, as she went on
sewing.</p>

<p>‘As well, my lord,’ she told him, ‘as I can look to be
these many months more. But women must learn such
lessons, which men have only to teach.’</p>

<p>He knew that he was outmatched. ‘I am thankful,
madam——’</p>

<p>‘My lord, you have every reason.’</p>

<p>‘I say, I am thankful; for I had a fear——’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>She gave him a sharp look. ‘Do you fear, my lord?
What have you to fear? Your friends are about you, your
wife a prisoner. What have you to fear?’</p>

<p>‘The tongue, madam.’</p>

<p>She had goaded him to this, and could have had him
at her mercy had she so willed it. But she was silent,
husbanding her best weapon against good time.</p>

<p>He went headlong on. ‘I had words for your private
ear. I had hoped that by a little intimacy, such as may
be looked for between——But it’s all one.’</p>

<p>She affected not to understand, pored over his fretful
scraps with the pure pondering of a child. ‘But——!
Converse, intimacy between us! Who is to prevent it?
Ah, my poor maids afflict you! What may be done before
matrons must be guarded from the maids. Indeed, my
lord, and that is my opinion. Go, my dears. The King
is about to discuss the affairs of marriage.’</p>

<p>They went out. The King immediately came to her,
stooped and took her hand up from her lap. She kept the
other hidden.</p>

<p>‘My Mary,’ he said—‘My Mary! let all be new-born
between us.’</p>

<p>She heard the falter in his voice, but considered rather
his fine white hand as it held her own, and judged it with
a cool brain. A frail hand for a man! So white, so thinly
boned, the veins so blue! Could such hands ever hold her
again? And how hot and dry! A fever must be eating
him. Her own hands were cold. New-born love—for this
hectic youth!</p>

<p>‘New-born, my lord?’ she echoed him, sighing. ‘Alas,
that which must be born should be paid for first. And
what the reckoning of that may be now, you know as well
as I. May not one new birth be as much as I can hope for,
or desire? I do think so.’</p>

<p>Fully as well as she he knew the peril she had been in,
she and the load she carried. He went down on his knee
beside her, and, holding her one hand, sought after the
other, which she hid.</p>

<p>‘My dear,’ he said earnestly, ‘oh, my dear, judge me
not hardly. I endeavoured to shield you last night—I held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
you fast—they dared not touch you! Remember it, my
Mary. As for my faults, I own them fairly. I was provoked—anger
moved me—bitter anger. I am young. I
am not even-tempered: remember this and forgive me.
And, I pray you, give me your hand.—No, the other, the
other! For I need it, my heart—indeed and indeed.’
That hand was gripped about a cold thing in her lap,
under her needlework. He could not have it without that
which it held; and now she knew that he should not. For
now she scorned him—that a man who had laid his own
hands to man’s work should now be on his knees, pleading
for his wife’s hands instead of snatching them—why, she
herself was the better man! Womanlike, she played with
what she could have killed in a flash.</p>

<p>‘My other hand, my lord? Do you ask for it? You
had it once, when you put rings upon it, but let it go. Do
you ask for it again? It can give you no joy.’</p>

<p>‘I need it, I need it! You should not deny me.’ He
craved it abjectly. ‘Oh, my soul, my soul, I kiss the one—let
me kiss the other, lest it be jealous.’</p>

<p>Unhappy conceit! Her eyes paled, and you might have
thought her tongue a snake’s, darting, forked, flickering out
and in as she struck hard.</p>

<p>‘Traitor!’ thus she stabbed him—‘Traitor, son of a
traitor, take and kiss it if you dare.’ She laid above her
caught hand that other, cool and firm, and opened it to
show him the handle of his own dagger. She took the
blade by the point and held the thing up, swinging before
his shocked eyes. ‘Lick that, hound!’ she said: ‘you
should know the taste of it better than I.’</p>

<p>He dropped her one hand, stared stupidly at the other:
but as his gaze concentrated upon the long smear on the
blade you could have seen the sweat rising on his temples.</p>

<p>She had read him exquisitely. After the first brunt of
terror, rage was what he felt—furious rage against the man
whom he supposed to have betrayed him. ‘Oh, horrible
traitor!’ he muttered by the window, whither he had
betaken himself for refuge,—‘Oh, Archie Douglas, if I
could be even with thee for this! Oh, man, man, man,
what a curious, beastly villain!’ He was much too angry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
now to be tender of his wife—either of her pity or revenge;
he turned upon her, threatening her from his window.</p>

<p>‘You shall not intimidate me. I am no baby in your
hands. This man is a villain, I tell you, whom I shall pursue
till he is below my heel. He has laid this, look you
for a trap. This was got by theft, and displayed by malice—devilish
craft of a traitor. And do you suppose I shall
let it go by? You mistake me, by God, if you do. Foul
thief!—black, foul theft!’</p>

<p>She pointed to the smear on the blade. ‘And this?’
she asked him: ‘what of this? Was this got by theft, my
lord? Was this dry blood thieved from a dead man? Or
do I mistake, as you suppose? Nay, wretch, but you know
that I do not. The man was dead long before you dared
touch him. Dead and in rags—and then the King drove
in his blade!’ Her face—Hecate in the winter—withered
him more than her words. Though these contained
a dreadful truth, the other chilled his blood. He crept
aimlessly about the room, feeling his heart fritter to water,
and all the remains of his heat congested in his head. He
tried to straighten his back, his knees: there seemed no
sap in his bones. And she sat on, with cold critical eyes,
and her lips hard together.</p>

<p>‘My Mary,’ he began to stammer, ‘this is all a plot
against my life—surely, surely you see it. I have enemies,
the worse in that they are concealed—I see now that all
the past has been but a plot—why, yes, it is plain as the
daylight! I entreat you to hear me: this is most dangerous
villainy—I can prove it. They swore to stand my friends—fast,
fast they swore it. And here—to your hand—is
proof positive. Surely, surely, you see how I am trapped
by these shameful traffickers!’</p>

<p>Her eyes never left his face, but followed him about the
room on his aimless tour; and whether he turned from the
window or the wall, so sure as he looked up he saw them
on him. They drove him into speech. ‘I meant honestly,’
he began again, shifting away from those watchful lights;
‘I meant honestly indeed. I have lived amiss—oh, I
know it well! A man is led into sin, and one sin leads to
another. But I am punished, threatened, in peril. Let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
me escape these nets and snares, I may do well yet. My
Mary, all may be well! Let us stand together—you and
I’—he came towards her with his hands out, stopped,
started back. ‘Look away—look away; take your eyes
from off me—they burn!’ He covered his own. ‘O God,
my God, how miserable I am!’</p>

<p>‘You are a prisoner as I am,’ said the Queen. ‘We
stand together because we are tied together. And as for
my eyes, what you abhor in them is what you have put
there. But since we are fellow-prisoners, methinks——’</p>

<p>He looked wildly. ‘Who says I am prisoner? If I
am—if I am—why, I am betrayed on all hands. My
kinsmen—my father—no, no, no! That is foolishness.
Madam,’ he asked her, being desperate, ‘who told you that
I was a prisoner?’</p>

<p>She glanced at the dagger. ‘This tells me. Why, think
you, should Archie Douglas have laid that in the grave,
except for me to find it there?’</p>

<p>It was, or it might have been, ludicrous to see his
dismay. He stared, with dots where his eyes should have
been; he puffed his cheeks and blew them empty; in his
words he lost all sense of proportion.</p>

<p>‘Beastly villain! Why, it is a plot against me! Why,
they may murder me! Why, this may have been their
whole intent! Lord God, a plot!’</p>

<p>He pondered this dreadfully, seeing no way of escape,
struggling with the injury of it and the pity of it. Consideration
that she was in the same plight, that he had
plotted against her, and now himself was plotted against:
there was food for humour in such a thought, but no food
for him. Of the two feelings he had, resentment prevailed,
and brought his cunning into play. ‘By heaven and hell,’
he said, ‘but I can counter shrewdly on these knaves. Just
wait a little.’ He cheered as he fumbled in his bosom.
‘You shall see, you shall see—now you shall see whether
or no I can foin and parry with these night-stabbers. Oh,
the treachery, the treachery! But wait a little—now, now,
now!’</p>

<p>He produced papers in a gush—bonds, schedules, signatures,
seals—all tumbled pell-mell into her lap. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
read there what she had guessed beforehand: Morton,
Ruthven, Lindsay, Douglas, Lethington—ah, she had forgotten
this lover of Mary Fleming’s!—Boyd—yes, yes, and
the stout Kirkcaldy of Grange. Not her brothers? No:
but she suspected that Lethington’s name implied Moray’s.
Well, Sir James would win her back Moray, she hoped.
She did not trouble with any more. ‘Yes, yes, your friends,
my lord. Your friends,’ she repeated, lingering on the
pleasant word, ‘who have made use of you to injure me,
and now have dropped you out of window. Well! And
now what will you do, fellow-prisoner?’</p>

<p>At her knees now, his wretched head in her lap, his
wretched tears staining her, he confessed the whole business,
sparing nobody, not even himself; and as his miserable
manhood lay spilling there it staled—like sour milk in
sweet—any remnants of attraction his tall person may
have had for her. She could calculate as she listened—and
so she did—to what extent she might serve herself yet
of this watery fool. But she could not for the life of her
have expressed her contempt for him. The thing had
come to pass too exactly after her calculation. If he had
been a boy she might have pitied him, or if, on entering
her presence, he had laid sudden hands upon her, exulting
in his force and using it mannishly; had he been greedy,
overbearing, insolent, snatching—and a man!—she might,
once more and for ever, have given him all her heart. But
a blubbering, truth-telling oaf—heaven and earth! could
she have wedded <i>this</i>? Well, he would serve to get her
out of Holyrood; and meantime she was tired and must
forgive, to get rid of him.</p>

<p>This was not so easy as it sounds, because at the first
word of human toleration she uttered he pricked up his
pampered ears. As she went on to speak of the lesson he
had learned, of the wisdom of trusting her for the future
and of being ruled by her experience and judgment, he
brushed his eyes and began to encroach. His tears had
done him good, and her recollected air gave him courage;
he felt shriven, more at ease. So he enriched himself of
her hand again, he edged up to share her seat; very
soon she felt his arm stealing about her waist. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
allowed these things because she had decided that she
must.</p>

<p>He now became very confidential, owning freely to his
jealousy of the Italian—surely pardonable in a lover!—talking
somewhat of his abilities with women, his high-handed
ways (which he admitted that he had in excess:
‘a fault, that!‘), his ambitions towards kingship, crowns-matrimonial,
and the like trappings of manhood. She
listened patiently, saying little, judging and planning
incessantly. This he took for favour, advanced from
stronghold to stronghold, growing as he climbed. The
unborn child—pledge of their love: he spoke of that. He
was sly, used double meanings; he took her presently by
the chin and kissed her cheek. Unresisted, he kissed her
again and again. ‘<i>Redintegratio amoris!</i>’ he cried, really
believing it at the moment. This very night he would
prove to her his amendment. Journeys end in lovers’
meeting! If she would have patience she should be a
happy wife yet. Would she—might he hope? Should
this day be a second wedding day? Her heart was as still
as freezing water, but her head prompted her to sigh and
half smile.</p>

<p>‘You consent! You consent! Oh, happy fortune!’
he cried, and kissed her mouth and eyes, and possessed as
much as he could.</p>

<p>‘Enough, my lord, enough!’ said she. ‘You forget, I
think, that I am a wife.’</p>

<p>He cursed himself for having for one moment forgotten
it, threw himself at her knees and kissed her held hands
over and over, then jumped to his feet, all his courage
restored. ‘Farewell, lady! Farewell, sweet Queen! I go
to count the hours.’ He went out humming a tavern catch
about Moll and Peg. She called her women in, to wash
her face and hands.</p>

<p class="tb">By riding long and changing often Sir James Melvill
had been able to salute the Earl of Moray on the home
side of Dunbar. The great man travelled, <i>primus inter
pares</i>, a little apart from his companions in exile—and
without Mr. Secretary Lethington. The fact is that Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
Secretary was as much distrusted by his friends as by Lord
Moray himself, and had been required at the last moment
to stay in town. Sir James, thanks to that, was not long
in coming to close quarters with the Earl, and frankly told
him that he had been sent by the Queen’s Majesty to
welcome him home. Lord Moray was bound to confess
to himself that, certainly, he had not looked for that. He
had expected to come back a personage to be feared, but
not one to be desired. The notion was not displeasing—for
if you are desired it may very well be because you are
feared. So all the advantage at starting lay with Sir James.</p>

<p>He went on to say how much need her Majesty felt in
her heart to stand well with her blood relations. As for
old differences—ah, well, well, they were happily over and
done with. My lord would not look for the Queen to
confess to an error in judgment, nor would she, certainly,
ever reproach him with the past. There was no question
of a treaty of forgiveness between a sister and her brother.
Urgency of the heart, mutual needs, were all! And her
needs were grievous, no question. Why, the very desire
she had for his help was proof that the past was past. Did
not his lordship think so?</p>

<p>His lordship listened to this tolerant chatter as became
a grave statesman. Without a sign to betray his face he
requested his civil friend—‘worthy Sir James Melvill’—to
rehearse the late occurrences—‘Of the which,’ he said,
‘hearing somewhat at Berwick, I had a heavy heart, misdoubting
what part I might be called upon to play in
the same.’</p>

<p>Whereupon Sir James, with the like gravity, related to
his noble friend all the details of a plot which nobody knew
more exactly than the man who heard him. It added zest
to the comic interlude that Sir James also knew quite well
that my lord had been one of the conspirators.</p>

<p>At the end his lordship said: ‘I thank you, Sir James
Melvill, for your tender recital of matters which may well
cause heart-searching in us all. Happy is that queen, I
consider, who has such a diligent servant! And happy
also am I, who can be sure of one such colleague as
yourself!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>‘All goes well,’ thinks Melvill. ‘I have my old sow by
the lug.’</p>

<p>If he had one lug, the Queen got the other. For when
my Lord of Moray reached Edinburgh that night, he was
told that her Majesty awaited him at Holyroodhouse.
Prisoner or not, she received him there, smiling and eager
to see him—and her gaolers standing by! And whenas
he hesitated, darkly bowing before her, she came forward
in a pretty, shy way; and, ‘Oh, brother, brother, I am glad
you have come to me,’ she said, and gave him her hands,
and let him kiss her cheek.</p>

<p>He murmured something proper,—his duty always remembered,
and the rest of the phrases,—but she, as if
clinging to him, ran on in a homelier speech. ‘Indeed,
there was need of you, brother James!’ she assured him,
and went on to tell him that which moved the stony man
to tears. At least, it is so reported, and I am glad to
believe it.</p>

<p>She walked with him afterwards in full hall, talking low
and quickly—candour itself. Her tones had a throbbing
note, and a note of confidence, which changed the whole
scene as she recited it. I repeat, the hall was full while
she walked with him there, up and down in the flickering
firelight—full of the men whose plots he had shared, and
hoped to profit by. Fine spectacle for my lords of the
Privy Council, for Mr. Archie Douglas and his cousin
Morton, fine for Mr. Secretary Lethington! Before she
kissed her brother good-night, before she went to bed, she
felt that she had done a good day’s work. And now, with
her triumph as good as won, she was ready for the crowning
of it.</p>

<p class="tb">There she was out-generalled: there she was beaten.
Match for all these men’s wit, she was outwitted by one
man’s sodden flesh. They undressed her, prepared her for
bed. She lay there in her pale, fragrant beauty, solace for
any lord’s desire, and conscious of it, and more fine for the
knowledge. She took deep breaths and draughts of ease;
she assured herself that she was very fair; she watched the
glimmering taper and read the shadows on the pictured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
wall as she waited for the crowning of her toil. The day
had been hers against all odds; the day is not always to
Venus, but the night is her demesne. So she waited and
drowsed, smiling her wise smile, secure, superb, and at ease.
But King Harry Darnley, very drunk, lay stertorous in his
own bed; nor dared Forrest, nor Standen, nor any man of
his household, stir him out of that. The Queen of Wine
and Honey had digged a pit of sweetness and hidden a
fine web all about it, and was fallen into the midst of it
herself.</p>

<p>And so, it is like enough, if the boar had not timely rent
the thigh of Adonis, Dame Venus herself might have
writhed, helpless in just such toils.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="II_CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="smaller">AFTERTASTE</span></h3>

<p>The Queen woke at eight o’clock in the morning and
called for a cup of cold water. She sat up to drink, and
was told that Antony Standen had been at the door at
half-past six, the King himself at seven. Listening to this
news with her lips in the water, her eyes grew bitter-bright.
‘He shall have old waiting at my chamber door,’ she said,
‘before he wins it.’ Then she began to weep and fling
herself about, to bite the coverlet and to gloom among the
pillows. ‘If I forget this past night may my God forget
me.’ O daughter of Babylon, wasted with misery! She
lay down again and shut her eyes, but fretted all the time,
twitching her arms and legs, making little angry noises,
shifting from side to side. Mary Seton sat by the bed,
cool and discreet.</p>

<p>The minutes passed, she enduring, until at last, unable
to bear the tripping of them, she started up so violently
that a great pillow rolled on to the floor. ‘I could kill
myself, Seton,’ she said, grinding her little teeth together,
‘I could kill myself for this late piece of work. Verjuice
in me!—I should die to drink my own milk. And all of
you there, whispering by the door, wagering, nudging one
another—“He’ll never come—never. Not he!” Oh, Jesu-Christ!’
she cried, straining up her bare arms, ‘let this
wound of mine keep green until the time!’</p>

<p>‘Hush, dear madam, oh, hush!’ says Seton, flushing to
hear her; but the Queen turned her a white, hardy face.</p>

<p>‘Why should I be hushed? Let me cry out my shame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
to all the world, that am the scorn of men and wedded
women. Who heeds? What matter what I say? Leave
me alone—I’ll not be hushed down.’</p>

<p>Seton was undismayed. ‘No wedded woman am I. I
love you, madam, and therefore I shall speak with you. I
say that, as he has proved his unworthiness, so you must
prove your pride. I say——’</p>

<p>There was hasty knocking at the door; the maid ran:
‘Who is it knocks?’</p>

<p>‘The King’s valet is without. The King asks if her
Majesty is awake.’</p>

<p>‘Let him ask,’ said the Queen: ‘I will never see him
again. Say that I am at prayers.’</p>

<p>Seton called, ‘Reply that Her Majesty is unable to see
the King at this time. Her Majesty awoke early, and is
now at prayers.’ She returned to the bed, where the
Queen lay on her elbow, picking her handkerchief to
pieces with her teeth.</p>

<p>‘Sweet madam,’ she said, ‘bethink you now of what
must be done this day. You wish to be avenged of your
enemies....’</p>

<p>The Queen looked keenly up.</p>

<p>‘Well, well, of all your enemies. But for this you must
first be free. And it grows late.’</p>

<p>The Queen put her hair from her face and looked at the
light coming in. She sat up briskly. ‘You are right, <i>ma
mie</i>. Come and kiss me. I have been playing baby until
my head aches.’</p>

<p>‘You will play differently now, I see,’ said Seton, ‘and
other heads may wish they had a chance to ache.’</p>

<p>The Queen took her maid’s face in her dry hands. ‘Oh,
Seton,’ she said, ‘you are a cordial to me. They have
taken my poor David, but have left me you.’</p>

<p>‘Nay, madam,’ says Seton, ‘they might take me too,
and you need none of my strong waters. There is wine
enough in your honey for all your occasions.’</p>

<p>A shadow of her late gloom crossed over her. ‘My
honey has been racked with galls. ’Tis you that have
cleared it. Give me my nightgown, and send for Father
Roche. I will say my prayers.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>With a spirit so responsive as hers, the will to move was
a signal for scheming to begin. Up and down her mind
went the bobbing looms, across and across the humming
shuttles, spinning the fine threads together into a fabric
whose warp was vengeance and the woof escape from self-scorn.
She must be free from prison this coming night;
but that was not the half: she intended to leave her captors
in the bonds she quitted. So high-mettled was she that I
doubt whether she would have accepted the first at the
price of giving up the second. Those being the ends of
her purpose, all her planning was to adjust the means; and
the first thing that she saw (and, with great courage, faced)
was that the King—this mutilated god, this botch, this
travesty of lover and lord—must come out with her. Long
before demure Father Roche could answer his summons
she had admitted that, and strung herself to accept it.
She must drag him after her—a hobble on a donkey’s leg—because
she dared not leave him behind. He had
betrayed his friends to her—true; but if she forsook him
he would run to them again and twice betray her. She
shrugged him out of mind. Bah! if she must take him
she would take him. ’Twas to be hoped he would get
pleasure of it—and so much for that. But whom dared
she leave? She could think of no one as yet but her
brother Moray. Overnight she had separated him from
the others, and she judged that he would remain separate.
Her thought was this:—‘He is a rogue among rogues, I
grant. But if you trust one rogue in a pack, all the others
will distrust him. Therefore he, being shunned by them,
will cleave to me; and they, not knowing how far I trust
him, will falter and look doubtfully at one another; and
some of them will come over to him, and then the others
will be stranded.’ Superficial reasoning, rough-and-ready
inference, all this. She knew it quite well, but judged that
it would meet the case of Scotland. It was only, as it
were, the scum of the vats she had seen brewing in France....
But I keep Father Roche from his prayers.</p>

<p class="tb">Affairs in the palace and precincts kept their outward
calm in the face of the buzzing town. Train-bands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
paraded the street, the Castle was for her Majesty, the
gates were faithful. In the presence of such monitors as
these the burgesses and their wives kept their mouths shut
as they stood at shop-doors, and when they greeted at the
close-ends they looked, but did not ask, for news. But the
Earl of Morton’s men still held the palace, and he himself
inspected the guard. There were no attempts to dispute
his hold, so far as he could learn, no blood-sheddings above
the ordinary, no libels on the Cross, no voices lifted against
him in the night. He held a morning audience in the
Little Throne-room, with his cousin Douglas for Chief
Secretary; and to his suitors, speaking him fair, gave fair
replies. But it may be admitted he was very uneasy.</p>

<p>That had not been a pleasant view for him overnight,
when the great Earl of Moray, newly returned, walked the
hall with the Queen upon his arm. His jaw had dropped
to see it. Here was a turn given to our affairs! Dreams
troubled him, wakefulness, and flying fancies, which to
pursue was torment and not to pursue certain ruin. He
slept late and rose late. At a sort of levee, which he held
as he dressed, he was peevish, snapped at the faithful
Archie, and almost quarrelled with Ruthven.</p>

<p>‘Do you bite, my lord?’ had said that savage. ‘If I
am to lose my head it shall be in kinder company. I
salute your lordship.’ And so he slammed out.</p>

<p>Morton knew that he must smooth him down before
the day was over, but just now there were more pressing
needs. He told his cousin that he must see the King at
the earliest.</p>

<p>Archie wagged his silvery head, looking as wise as an
old stork. ‘Why, that is very well,’ says he; ‘but how if
he will not see you?’</p>

<p>‘What do you mean, man?’ cried the Earl upon him.</p>

<p>‘Why, this, cousin,’ said Archie: ‘that the King is out
of all hand the morn. I went to his door betimes and
listened for him, but could hear nothing forby the snivelling
of his boy, therefore made so bold as to open. There I
found the minion Forrest crying his heart out over the bed,
and could hear our kinsman within howling blasphemy in
English.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Pooh, man, ’tis his way of a morning,’ said Morton,
heartening himself. ‘What did you then?’</p>

<p>Archie screwed his lips to the whistle, and cocked one
eyebrow at the expense of the other.</p>

<p>‘What did I? I did the foolishest thing of all my days,
when I sent in my name by the boy. Strutting moorcock,
call me, that hadna seen him all the day before! Oh,
cousin Morton, out comes our King like a blustering gale
o’ March, and takes me by the twa lugs, and wrenches at
me thereby, and shakes me to and fro as if I were a sieve
for seeds. “Ye black-hearted, poisonous beast!” he roars;
“ye damned, nest-fouling chick of a drab and a preacher!”
says he—ah, and worse nor that, cousin, if I could lay my
tongue to sic filthy conversation. “I’ll teach ye,” says he
thunderous, “I’ll teach ye to play your games with your
King!” He was fumbling for his dagger the while, and
would have stabbed me through and through but for them
that stood by and got him off me. Cousin, I fairly ran.’</p>

<p>The Earl looked sternly at him. ‘Tell me the truth,
you Archie. What devil’s trick had you played upon
him?’</p>

<p>He looked so blankly, swore so earnestly, Nothing,
upon his honour, that he had to be believed.</p>

<p>‘Well then,’ said Morton, ‘what may this betide?’</p>

<p>‘Woe can tell your lordship! Little good to you and
me belike.’</p>

<p>Lord Morton said, ‘I doubt he’ll play us false. I doubt
the knave was working the courage into him.’</p>

<p>And there you see why he was uneasy in his ruling of
the palace. Heavy, ox-like, slow-footed man, thick-blooded,
fond of thick pleasures, slow to see, slow to
follow, slow to give up—he felt now, without more rhyme
or reason to support him, that his peril was great. The
King was about to betray him. A hot mist of rage
flooded his eyes at the thought; and then his heart gave a
surge upwards and he felt the thick water on his tongue.
‘If he betray me, may God help him if He cares!’</p>

<p>After his duties in the Little Throne-room, in this grave
conjuncture, it seemed good to him to get speech with Mr.
Secretary, who had been let out of the house, but had let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
himself in again when his master, my lord of Moray, came
home.</p>

<p>‘Pray, Mr. Secretar,’ says he, ‘have you any tidings of
my lord of Moray?’</p>

<p>Lethington became dry. ‘I had proposed to meet my
lord, as your lordship may recollect. It seemed good to
your lordship that I should not go, but that Sir James
Melvill should—with results which I need not particularise.
I have not been sent for by my lord of Moray since his
home-coming, therefore I know no more of his lordship
than your lordship’s self knows.’</p>

<p>The Earl of Morton rumbled his lips. ‘Prutt! Prutt!
I wonder now....’ He began to feel sick of his authority.</p>

<p>‘The King, Mr. Secretar,’ he began again, ‘is in some
distemperature at this present. I am in doubt—it is not
yet plain to me—I regret the fact, I say.’</p>

<p>‘One should see his Majesty,’ says Lethington. ‘No
doubt but Mr. Archibald here——’</p>

<p>‘By my soul, man,’ said Mr. Archibald with fervour, ‘I
don’t go near him again for a thousand pound—English.’</p>

<p>‘No, no, Mr. Secretar,’ says my lord; ‘but consider
whether yourself should not adventure my lord of Moray.’</p>

<p>‘My lord——’</p>

<p>Morton lifted his hand. ‘Man,’ he said, ‘you <i>must</i> do
it. I tell you, the sooner the better.’ The hand fell
upon the table with a thud. Lethington started, then left
the room without a word.</p>

<p>Very little was said between the two gentlemen at this
moment in charge of Holyrood until the Secretary’s return.
The Master of Lindsay intruded upon them to report that
the Earl of Lennox had left the palace, had left Edinburgh,
and had ridden hard to the west. Lord Morton nodded to
signify that his ears could do their duty.</p>

<p>‘Like son, like father,’ said Archie when the Master
had gone.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards Lethington knocked at the door,
entered, advanced to the table, and stood there, looking
at the ink-horn, which he moved gently about.</p>

<p>‘Well, sir! We are here to listen,’ cried Morton, in
a fever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>Lethington was slow to answer even then.</p>

<p>‘I have been admitted to my lord of Moray,—so much
there is to say. He had his reader with him, but came
out to me. When I began to speak he regretted at once
that he could not hear me at any length. He showed me
his table encumbered with business, and declined at the
present to add any more to the litter. I urged your
lordship’s desire to have speech with him as soon as might
be; he replied that his own desire was always, in all
things, to serve your lordship. I said, “Serve his lordship
then in this”: upon the which he owned that he failed of
strength. “I have a traveller’s ache in my bones,” saith
he. “Let my Lord Morton have patience.”’</p>

<p>He stopped there.</p>

<p>Lord Morton took a turn about the room. ‘No more
than that said he, Lethington? No more than that?’</p>

<p>‘His lordship said no more, my lord. And therefore,
seeing that he plainly wished it, I took my leave.’</p>

<p>The Earl looked at Archie Douglas: some secret
intelligence passed between them in which the Secretary
had no share.</p>

<p>‘I am going to speak with my lord of Ruthven in his
chamber,’ then said he. ‘And, cousin, do you come also.’</p>

<p>The guard presented arms to the great man as he went
down the hall, and a few underlings—women of the house,
grooms of the closet and coffer—ran after him with
petitions; but he waved away all and sundry. They fell
back, herded into groups and whispered together. The
Secretary came out alone and paced the hall deep in
thought. One or two eyed him anxiously. How did he
stand now? It was a parlous time for Scotland when
nobody knew to whom to cringe for a favour.</p>

<p class="tb">Then—two hours after dinner—word was brought down
into the hall that the Queen would receive the Earl of
Morton and certain other named persons in the Throne-room.
Great debate over this. Lord Ruthven was for
declining to go. ‘We are masters here. ’Tis for us to
receive.’</p>

<p>But Lord Lindsay shook his ragged head. ‘No, no,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
Ruthven,’ he says, ‘take counsel, my fine man. It is ill
to go, but worse to stay away.’</p>

<p>‘How’s that, then?’ cries Ruthven, white and fierce.</p>

<p>‘Why, thus,’ the elder replied. ‘If you go, you show
that you are master. If you go not, you betray that you
doubt it.’</p>

<p>‘I see it precisely contrary,’ says Ruthven.</p>

<p>‘Then,’ he was told, ‘you have a short vision. It is the
strong man can afford to unbar the door.’</p>

<p>The Earl of Morton was clearly for going. ‘I take it,
my lord of Moray is behind this message. Let us see
what he will do. He is bound to us as fast as man can be.’</p>

<p>They sent up Lethington, who came back with the
answer that my lord of Moray had been summoned in
like wise, and would not fail of attendance upon her
Majesty. This settled the masters of Holyrood. ‘Where
he goes there must we needs be also.’</p>

<p>Archie Douglas and Lethington had not been required
by the Queen; but when Archie was for rubbing his hands
over that, the other advised him to take his time.</p>

<p>‘You are not the less surely hanged because they let
you see you are not worth hanging,’ said the Secretary.
Archie damned him for a black Genevan.</p>

<p>At the time set the Earls of Morton, Argyll, and Glencairn,
the Lords Ruthven, Rothes, and Lindsay, and some
few more, went upstairs with what state they could muster.</p>

<p>They found the Queen on the throne, pale, stiff in the
set of her head, but perfectly self-possessed. Three of her
maids and Lady Argyll were behind the throne. Upon
her right hand stood the King in a long ermine cloak,
upon her left the Earl of Moray in black velvet. Lord
John Stuart and a sprinkling of young men held the inner
door, and a secretary, in poor Davy’s shoes, sat at a little
table in the window. The six lords filed in according to
their degrees of ranking. Ruthven, behind Lindsay,
jogged his elbow: ‘See the pair of them there. Betrayed,
man, betrayed!’</p>

<p>None of them was pleased to see that Moray had been
admitted first, and yet none of them in his heart had
expected anything else. It was the King who drew all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
their reproaches: in some sense or another Moray was
chartered in villainy.</p>

<p>The Queen, looking straight before her, moistened her
lips twice, and spoke in a low voice, very slowly and
distinctly.</p>

<p>‘I have sent for you, my lords, that I may hear in the
presence of the King my consort, and of these my kindred
and friends, what your wisdoms may have to declare
concerning some late doings of yours. As I ask without
heat, so I shall expect to be answered.’ Pausing here, she
looked down at her hands placid in her lap. So unconscious
did she seem of anything but her own dignity and
sweet estate, you might have taken her for a girl at her
first Communion.</p>

<p>The Earl of Morton moved out a step, and made the
best speech he could of it. He had the gift, permitted to
slow-witted men, of appearing more honest than he was;
for tardiness of utterance is easily mistaken for gravity,
and gravity (in due season) for uprightness. One has got
into the idle habit of connecting roguery with fluency.
But it must be allowed to Morton that he did not attempt
to disavow his colleagues. If he urged his own great
wrongs as an excuse for violence, he claimed that the
wrongs of Scotland had cried to him louder still. He now
held the palace, he said, for the prevention of mischief,
and should be glad to be relieved of the heavy duty.
Then he talked roundabout—of requitals in general—how
violent griefs provoked violent medicines—how men will
fight tooth and nail for their consciences. Lastly he made
bolder. ‘If I fear not, madam, to invoke the holy eyes of
my God upon my doings, it would not become me to quail
under your Majesty’s. And if that which I hold dearest is
enchained, I should be a recreant knight indeed if I failed
of a rescue.’ He glanced toward the King at this point;
but the young man might have been a carven effigy. His
end therefore—for he knew now that he had been betrayed—was
a lame one: a plea for mutual recovery of esteem,
an act of oblivion, articles to be drawn up and signed,
<i>et cætera</i>. The Queen, placidly regarding her fingers,
drew on the others after him one by one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>The Earl of Glencairn had nothing to say, as he proved
by every word he uttered; the Earl of Argyll began a
speech, but caught his wife’s eye and never finished it.
Lord Lindsay, an honest, hot-gospel, rough sort of man—who
might have been a Knox in his way—said a great
deal. But he was long over it, and slow, and prolix; and
the Queen none too patient. At ‘Secondly, madam, you
shall mark——’ she began to tap with her toe; and then one
yet more impatient broke in, feeling that he must shriek
under his irritation unless he could relieve it by speech.
This was Lord Ruthven, a monomaniac, with one cry for
the world and one upon whom to cry it. If he spoke his
rages to the Queen in form, he aimed them at the King in
substance, and never once looked elsewhere, or threatened
with his finger any other than that stock-headed starer out
of painted eyes. He thrust away Lindsay with a pawing
hand, and—‘Oh, madam, will you listen to me now?’ says
he. ‘We speak our pieces before ye like bairns on a
bench, who have acted not long since like men, and men
wronged. And who are we, when all’s said, to justify
ourselves? Who was the most aggrieved among us? Let
that man speak. Who had most cause to cry out, Down
with the thief of my honour? Let him say it now. What
was our injury compared to that man’s? If we played in
his scene, who gave out the parts? If we laid hands upon
our Queen, by whose command did we so? And into
whose hands did we commit her royal person? Let him
answer, and beat us down with his words, if to any hands
but his own.’ Wrought up by his own eloquence, driving
home his terrible questions, he had advanced unawares
close to the man he threatened. The King jumped
back with a short cry; but the Queen, who had been
straining forward to listen, like a racer at his mark,
interposed.</p>

<p>‘I am listening,’ she said; ‘continue, Ruthven.’</p>

<p>Ruthven, at this check, began to cast about for his
words. He had lost his flow. ‘As for yon Davy, madam,
I’ll not deny airt and pairt in his taking——’</p>

<p>‘Why, how should you indeed?’ says the Queen, smiling
rather sharply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I say I will not, madam,’ says Ruthven, flurried; then
with a savage snarl he turned short on the King and fleshed
his tooth there.</p>

<p>‘And you!’ he raved at him: ‘deny it you, if you dare!’</p>

<p>The King went white as a sheet.</p>

<p>‘Man,’ said the Earl of Morton finely, ‘hold your peace.
I lead this company.’</p>

<p>Lord Ruthven said no more, and Morton took up anew
his parable. What he did was well done: he did not give
ground, yet was conciliatory. It was a case for terms, he
said. Let articles be drawn up, lands be restored, offices
stand as before the slaughter, the old forfeitures be overlooked,
religion on either side be as it had been: in fact,
let that come which all hoped for, the Golden Age of
Peace.</p>

<p>The Queen consulted with her brother, ignored her
husband, then accepted. Lethington was to draw up
articles and submit them. For Peace’s sake, if it were
possible, she would sign them. Rising from her throne,
she dismissed her gaolers. She took Moray’s arm, just
touched the King’s with two fingers, and walked through
the lines made by her friends, a page going before to clear
the way. The moment she was in her room she sent Des-Essars
out with a letter, which she had ready-written, for
the Earl of Bothwell.</p>

<p>Left with his fellow-tragedians, Ruthven for a time was
ungovernable, with no words but ‘black traitor—false,
perjuring beast of a thief’—and the like. Morton, to the
full as bartered as himself, did not try to hold him. He
too was working into a steady resentment, and kindling a
grudge which would smoulder the longer but burn the
more fiercely than the madman’s spluttering bonfire. And
he was against all sudden follies. When Ruthven, foaming,
howled that he would stab the King in the back, Morton
grumbled, ‘Too quick a death for him’; and Lindsay said
drily, ‘No death at all. Yon lad is wiser than Davy—wears
a shirt that would turn any blade.’ ‘Then I’ll have
at him in his bed,’ says Ruthven. And Lindsay, to clinch
the matter, scoffs at him with, ‘Pooh, man, the Queen is
his shirt of mail. Are you blind?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>Into this yeasty flood, with courage truly remarkable,
the Earl of Moray steered his barque, coming sedately
back from his escort of the Queen. At first they were
so curious about his visit that they forgot the vehement
suspicion there was of treachery from him also. The precision
of his steering was admirable, but he ran too close
to the rocks when he spoke of the Queen as ‘a young lady
in delicate health, for whom, considering her eager temper
and frail body, the worst might have been feared in the
late violent doings.’</p>

<p>Here Morton cut in. ‘I call God to witness, my lord,
and you, too, Ruthven, shall answer for me, whether or not
I forbade the slaughter of that fellow before her face. For
I feared, my lord, that very health of hers.’</p>

<p>‘And you did well to fear it, my lord,’ said the Earl of
Moray; and that was the turn too much.</p>

<p>Said Ruthven to him dangerously, ‘You make me sick
of my work.’ He peered with grinning malice into the
inscrutable face. ‘Tell me, you, my lord of Moray, what
did <i>you</i> look for in the business? What thought <i>you</i> would
come of murder at the feet of a woman big? God in
heaven, sir, what is it you look for? what is it you think of
day after day?’</p>

<p>Lord Moray blinked—but no more. ‘Hush, hush, Lord
Ruthven, lest you utter what would grieve all who love
Scotland.’</p>

<p>Ruthven howled. ‘Man, do you talk of Scotland?
Are we friends here? Are we in the kirk? If we are in
council, for God’s sake talk your mind. Ah!—talk of that,
my good lord——’ he pointed to the empty throne. ‘Man,
man, man! there’s your kirk and your altar—you prater
about Scotland’s love.’ For a moment he fairly withered
the man; but then, as drowning in a flood-tide of despair,
he lifted up his hands and covered his tormented eyes.
‘Oh, I am sick just,’ he said, ‘sick of your lying—sick, I
tell you, sick—sick to death!’</p>

<p>The Earl of Moray made a little sign with his eyebrows
and closed eyes; and they left him alone with Ruthven.
It should never be denied of this man that he had the
courage of his father’s race.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>The ‘Articles of Peace and Oblivion’ were drawn up,
tendered on knees, and overlooked by her Majesty.</p>

<p>‘I see your name here, Mr. Secretary, as in need of
mercy,’ she said, with a finger on the place. Of course
she had known that he was up to the chin in the plot,
but she could rarely resist making the sensitive man
wriggle.</p>

<p>He murmured something unusually fatuous, painfully
conscious of his standing.</p>

<p>‘Oh, sir,’ she said, ‘if you seek for my pardon you shall
have it. I am contented with a few things. But go you now
and sue for it in the maids’ closet. You will find Fleming
there. I cannot answer for her, I warn you; for if you say
to a maid, “Love me, love my dog,” it is possible she may
rejoin, “Serve me, serve my mistress.” That, at least, is
the old-fashioned pleading in the courts of love.’</p>

<p>He was greatly confused, the obsequious, fertile man,
and she greatly entertained.</p>

<p>‘Go, Mr. Secretary, and pray you find some phrases as
you go. Tongues ring sharply in the closet.’ She signed
the Articles, and he was backing himself out when she
stopped him with a seemingly careless word. ‘Ah, I had
almost forgot. These Articles breathe peace.’ She took
them from him and read the words. ‘“Peace, mutual
forbearance and goodwill”: very fair words, upon which
we must hope for fair performance. The guard at the
doors and gates is removed no doubt? See to that, Mr.
Secretary, before you can hope for pardon in the maids’
closet. Your lady will not love you the more because you
keep her in a cage.’</p>

<p>This was kittle work, as they say. Unless the guard
were off she could never get out. Lethington, however,
took the hint, acted upon his own responsibility, and found
none to stop him. The lords—masters of Holyrood—were
otherwise employed: Lord Ruthven spoke of hanging himself;
the Earl of Morton was inclining to think that Articles
might, for this once, make all safe. Alone, the Earl of
Moray admonished his servant, not for removing the guard,
but for not having done so earlier. What peace he made
afterwards in the maids’ closet hath never been revealed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>The Queen went to bed very early and slept like a child
in arms. Everything was in train.</p>

<p class="tb">At two o’clock in the morning the King was called, but
answered the summons himself, fully dressed, armed and
cloaked.</p>

<p>‘I am ready,’ he said, before the messenger could speak.
‘Fetch Standen. I go to the Queen.’</p>

<p>He crept along the passage to the dimly lighted cabinet,
where he had of late seen murder, and had to wait there as
best he could. He spent the time in walking up and down—an
exercise whereby a man, in fear already, gains terror
with every pace: so agitated was he that when, after an
age of squittering misery, the Queen came in deeply
hooded, he forgot everything and burst out with ‘O God,
madam, make haste!’</p>

<p>She gave him no answer, but poured herself some wine,
added water, and drank. It was terrible to him to see how
much at her ease she was, sipping her drink, looking about
the cabinet, recalling critically (if the truth is to be told)
the stasimons of the late tragic scene.</p>

<p>Mary Seton came in, and Des-Essars, labouring with a
portmantle and some pistols.</p>

<p>‘Drink, my children,’ she bade them in French, and they
obeyed, taking stay and leisure from her.</p>

<p>The King bit his nails, fretted and fumed—had not had
the nerve to drink, even if he had had the invitation.</p>

<p>Standen stood by the wall, stolid as his habit was—the
flaxen, solemn English youth, with but one cherubic face
for a rape, a funeral, a battle, a christening, or the sacrament.
The Queen drew Seton’s attention to him in a
whisper, and made the girl laugh.</p>

<p>Presently they heard a step, and then Stewart of
Traquair was to be seen, stalwart and watchful, in the
doorway.</p>

<p>‘Ready, Traquair?’—the Queen’s voice.</p>

<p>‘All’s ready, ma’am.’</p>

<p>She fastened her hood, patting the bows flat. ‘Come,
Seton, come, Baptist,’ she said, and gave her hand into
Traquair’s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>He kissed it before he led her away. Des-Essars went
first with a shaded lantern.</p>

<p>The great dark house was perfectly quiet as they went
downstairs and through the chapel by the tombs of the
kings. Just here, however, the Queen stopped and called
back Des-Essars. ‘Where does he lie?’ she asked him;
and he pointed out the stone—she was standing almost
upon it—and for many a day remembered the curious
regard she had for it: how she hovered, as it were, over
the place, looking at it, smiling quietly towards it, as if it
afforded her some quaint thought. Words have been put
into her mouth which, according to him, she never said—melodramatic
words they are, rough makeshifts of some
kind of art embodying what was to come. According to
Des-Essars, she said nothing, neither resolved, nor promised,
nor predicted; nothing broke her smiling, considering
silence over this new grave.</p>

<p>‘To see her there,’ he says, ‘in the lantern-light, so easy,
so absorbed, so <i>amused</i>, was terrible to more witnesses than
one. It opened to me secret doors never yet suspected.
Was murder only curious to her? Was horror a kind of
joy?’</p>

<p>But it frightened Mary Seton out of her courage. ‘Oh,
what do you see in there, madam?’ she whispered. ‘What
moves your mirth in his grave?’</p>

<p>The Queen turned her head as if shaken out of a stare.
She met Mary Seton’s eyes in the lantern-light, and
laughed.</p>

<p>‘Come away, madam, come away. Look no more.
There’s a taint.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, yes,’ says the Queen; ‘I am ready. Where is the
King?’</p>

<p>‘The King is gone, madam,’ said Stewart of Traquair;
‘and I think your Majesty will do well to be after him.’</p>

<p>This was true. Arthur Erskine, holding the horses outside
the town wall, told her that the King had ridden forward
at once, at a gallop, with his man Standen. She was
therefore left with but two—himself and Traquair—for
escort; but he assured her that every step had been taken,
she would be in no sort of danger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Danger!’ she said, laughing lightly. ‘No, no, Erskine,
I do not fear it. Ruthven’s dagger seeks not my
back.’</p>

<p>They lifted her up, the rest mounted after her; they
walked their horses clear of the suburb. After some half-mile
or more of steady trotting the Queen reined up and
stopped the party. She listened; they all did. Far away
you could hear the regular galloping of a horse, pulsing in
the dark like some muffled pendulum. Now and again
another’s broke into it and confused the rhythm.</p>

<p>‘There rides in haste our sovereign lord,’ said the
Queen. ‘Come, we must follow him.’</p>

<p class="tb">By Niddry House—under the lee of the wall—she found
the Earls of Huntly and Bothwell, Lord Seton, and a
company of twenty horsemen waiting. The hour had
gone five.</p>

<p>‘God save Scotland!’ had called Traquair, and Bothwell’s
strident voice had countercried, ‘God save the Queen
of Scotland!’</p>

<p>‘That voice hath blithe assurance,’ said she when she
heard it. She joyed in adventure and adventurers.</p>

<p>She asked for news of the King. ‘Where is my consort,
Lord Bothwell? Rode he this way?’</p>

<p>‘Madam, he did, and had a most mischievous scare of
us. We knew him by the way he damned us all. But
he’s well away by now. You may hear him yet.’</p>

<p>She gloomed at that. ‘Ay,’ said she, ‘I have heard
him. I shall always hear him, I think.’ Then she shivered.
‘Let us ride on, sirs; the night is chill.’</p>

<p>Nobody spoke much. Lord Bothwell kept close to her
right hand, Lord Huntly to her left. They would change
horses at Gladsmuir.</p>

<p class="tb">The tide was breaking over wet rocks, one pale streak
of light burnished the rim of the sea, as Lord Bothwell
lifted down his Queen. Astounding to feel how fresh and
feat she was! The dark hull of a castle could just be seen,
suspended as it seemed above a cloud-bank, with sea-birds
looming suddenly large or fading to be small as they swept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
in and out of the fog. Little tired waves broke and recoiled
near by upon the weedy stones.</p>

<p>‘Dunbar, madam,’ says Bothwell, his hands still holding
her—‘and the good grey guard of the water.’</p>

<p>The King, they told her, had been in bed those three
hours.</p>

<h3 id="II_CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="smaller">KING’S EVIL</span></h3>

<p>Sir James Melvill, wise and mature, travelled gentleman,
made nothing of a ride to Dunbar in the slush of
snow. He was careful to take it before the dawn, and
arrived late, to find the Queen not visible. They told him
she had come in some hours after daybreak, exhausted,
but not nearly so exhausted as her horse. It was hardly
likely she would rise the day.</p>

<p>‘You’ll let her Majesty know that I’m here, with my
service to ye, Mr. Erskine. And since ye’re so obliging
I’ll take a mouthful just of your spiced wine.’ Thus Sir
James; who was sipping at this comfortable cup when the
Earl of Bothwell came in, stamping the winter from his
boots, and recalled him to his privileges. To see him
make his bow to a lord was to get a lesson in the niceties
of precedence. He knew to the turn of a hair how far to
go, and unless the occasion were extraordinary, never
departed from the Decreet of Ranking. In the present
case, however, all things considered, he may have judged,
‘This Earl has merited the salutation of a Prince-Bishop.’
That presupposed, the thing was well done. Sir James’s
heels went smartly together—but without a click, which
would have been too military for the day; the body was
slightly bent, with one hand across the breast. But his
head fell far, and remained down-hung in deepest reverence
of the hero. It is exactly thus that a devotional traveller
in a foreign town might salute, but not adore, the passing
Host. ‘I will not bow the knee to Baal; no, but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
will honour this people’s God.’ And thus bowed Sir
James.</p>

<p>‘Now, who graces me so highly?’ cried Bothwell when
he saw him; and immediately, ‘Eh, sirs, it is honest Sir
James! So the wind hath veered in town already! Man,
you’re my weathercock in this realm. Your hand, Sir
James, your hand, your hand. Never stoop that venerable
pow to me.’</p>

<p>‘Always the servant of your lordship,’ murmured Sir
James, much gratified.</p>

<p>‘Havers, James!’ says Bothwell, and sat upon the
table. He swung his leg and looked at his sea boots as
he talked, reflecting aloud, rather than conversing.</p>

<p>‘The Queen is sound asleep,’ he said, ‘as well enough
she may be. Good sakes, my man, what a proud and
gladsome lady have we there! I tell you, I have seen
young men ride into action more tardily than she into the
perilous dark. She flung herself to the arms of foul
weather like a lammock to his dam’s dug. You’d have
said’—he lowered his voice—‘you’d have said she was at
the hunting of a hare, if you’d seen her gallop—with
Adonis fleeting before her.’</p>

<p>Sir James nodded, as if to say—‘A hint is more than
enough for me.’</p>

<p>‘Well!’ cried Bothwell, ‘well! What scared the gowk,
then?’</p>

<p>‘My lord,’ said Sir James, ‘you must observe, he had
been by when Lord Ruthven’s knife was at work, slicing
Davy. He knew the way of it, d’ye see?’</p>

<p>Bothwell flung up his head. ‘Ay! he was all in a
flutter of fear. The bitter fools that they are! Every
traitor of them betraying the other, and a scamper who
shall do mischief and be first away. But this one here—he’s
none too safe, ye ken. He’s dug his own grave, I
doubt. Before long time you and I, Melvill, shall see him
by Davy’s side.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, my lord of Bothwell——’ Sir James was scandalised.</p>

<p>‘Fear nothing, man—I must talk. Here, in this place,
what is he? Who heeds him, where he comes or whither he
goes? Why, this skipjack of Brabant is the better man!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>The skipjack of Brabant was Des-Essars, come down
to call Lord Bothwell to the Queen. She was about to
hold a council, and Melvill was to abide the upshot.</p>

<p>‘Is the King to be there, do you know, Baptist?’ says
my lord, his hand on the lad’s shoulder.</p>

<p>‘The King sleeps, my lord,’ he replied. ‘I heard her
Majesty say that he could not do better.’</p>

<p>‘Her Majesty has the rights of him by now,’ says
Bothwell. ‘Well—we shall work none the worse without
him. Sir James, your servant. If I can help you, you
shall see her.’</p>

<p>‘So your lordship will bind me fast to your service,’
bowed Sir James, and watched the pair depart. He
observed that Des-Essars’ crown was level with the Earl’s
cheek-bone.</p>

<p class="tb">Let me deal with the fruit of this council while I may.
Sir James took a seed of it, as it were, back to Edinburgh,
planted and watered it, and saw an abundant harvest, of
sweet and bitter mixed. As for instance,—to the Earls of
Moray and Argyll went full pardons of all offences; to
Glencairn and Rothes the hope of some such thing upon
proof of good disposition—just enough to separate men not
quite dangerous from men desperate. To them, those
desperate men, came the last shock. Writs of treason
were out against the Earl of Morton, Lords Ruthven and
Lindsay and the Master of Lindsay, against Archibald
Douglas of Whittingehame, William Kirkcaldy of Grange,
Ker of Fawdonsyde and their likes; also, definitely and
beyond doubt, against William Maitland, younger of
Lethington. The Secretary had to thank Lord Bothwell
for that, for the Queen would have spared him if she could
for Mary Fleming’s sake. These writs were served that
very night and copies affixed to the Market-cross. The
smaller fry—men in Morton’s livery, jackals and foxes of
the doors—were to be taken as they fell in and hanged at
conveniency. Many were apprehended in their beds before
Sir James could be snug in his own.</p>

<p>One may look, too, for a moment at the last conference
of them that of late had been masters of Holyrood. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
had in Lord Morton’s big house—a desultory colloquy
broken by long glooms.</p>

<p>‘If you are still for hanging yourself, Ruthven,’ said my
Lord Morton, in one of these pauses, ‘you’ve time.’</p>

<p>And Ruthven turned his eyes about with evident pain.
Those thought, who looked at him, that he had not so
much time. He was horribly ill, with fever in bones and
blood. ‘I’m not for that now, my lord,’ he said, ‘I have a
better game than that in hand.’</p>

<p>‘I could name you one if you were needing it,’ said
Morton again, with a glance towards Archie Douglas.
Listening and watching, the grey-headed youth chuckled,
and rubbed his dry hands together.</p>

<p>‘Ay,’ said Ruthven, observing the action, and sickening
of actor and it, ‘slough your skin, snake, and bite the
better.’</p>

<p>‘Man, Ruthven,’ said Morton impatiently, ‘you talk too
much of what you will do, and spend too much of your
spleen on them that would serve ye if ye would let them.
Body of me, we have time before us to scheme a great
propyne for this good town that spews us out like so much
garbage.’</p>

<p>‘We have that, cousin,’ says Archie, ‘if but we accord
together.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, traitors all, traitors all!’ Ruthven was muttering
to himself; then (as he thought of the chief of traitors)
burst out—‘When we have done his butcher’s work—he
heels us out of doors! Sublime, he washes his hands and
goes to bed. We are the night-men, look you. Foh, we
smell of our trade! what king could endure us? Oh, lying,
sleek, milky traitor!’</p>

<p>Lord Morton, whose rage lay much deeper, thought all
this just wind and vapour. ‘To fret and cry treachery,
Ruthven! Pooh, a French trick, never like to save your
face. Why, poor splutterer, nothing will save that but to
mar another’s face.’</p>

<p>‘Your talk against my talk,’ cried Ruthven; ‘and will
you do it any better?’</p>

<p>Lord Morton flushed to a heavy crimson colour, and
his eyes were almost hidden. ‘Ay, mark me, that I will.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
I will score him deep with this infamy.’ He went to the
window and stood there alone. Nobody could draw him
into talk again.</p>

<p>There was much bustle in Edinburgh during the week,
and more suitors to the Earl of Moray than he had time to
see. Mr. Secretary got no joy out of him; he was kind to
the Earl of Morton and spoke him many hopeful words;
he shook his finger at Lord Ruthven. ‘Fie, my lord,’ he
said, ‘you should wear a finer face. Turn you to your God,
Lord Ruthven, and store up grain against the lean years to
come. Root up these darnels from your garden-plot, lest
they choke the good seed sowed in you. Let stout Mr.
Knox be your exemplar, then; behold how he can harden
his brows. Farewell, my lord: be sure of my friendship;
take kindly to the soil of England. There are stout hearts
in Newcastle, a godly congregation, to which I commend
you.’</p>

<p>Ruthven turned away from him without a word to say,
and never saw him again. With Morton, Lindsay, and the
rest, he took the English road. Mr. Secretary Lethington
went to my lord Atholl’s in the west; my lord of Argyll
became a Queen’s man. Within the bare week after the
flight to Dunbar the ragged corse of the Italian lay as
untrodden by enemies as if Jerusalem had been his sepulture.
But we are out-running our matter: we must be
back at Dunbar with Queen Mary.</p>

<p class="tb">From that castle Lord Bothwell wrote to his wife, to
this effect:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Attend me not these many days. The alders may bud by
Hermitage Water before I kiss the neck of my dear. For such
business as here we have was never done in the Debatable Land
since Solway Moss was reddened; such a riding in and forth of
messengers, such a sealing of dooms, rewards and forfeitures—no,
nor such a flocking of lords anxious to prove their wisdoms in
their loves.... She is hearted like a man. She rises early every
day, and sets to her blessing and banning of men’s lives with as
sharp an edge as I to my beef at noon. She has a care for all
who have served or dis-served her, and is no more frugal of her
embracing than of her spurning heel. One man only she hath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
clean out of mind; for him she hath neither inclination nor
disgust. She asketh not his company, neither seeketh to have
him away. He is as though he were not—still air in the chamber,
for which you ope not the window, as needing more of it, nor
shut-to the window, for fear of more. Doth he enter her presence—why
not? the room is wide. Doth he go out—why not? the
world is wider. How this came about it were too long to tell
you; this only will I say, that it came late, for at her first alighting
here she feared him mortally, as if she viewed in him the
ghost of her old self. That was a sickness of the mind, not
against nature; now gone, and he with it. Needs must I admire
her for the banishment....</p>

<p>But to return. Business ended—more sharply than you would
believe by any young head but your own—she wins to the open
weather. She walks abroad, she takes my arm. Yes, and indeed,
I am grown to be somewhat in this realm. She rides o’er the
brae; your servant at her stirrup; she sails the sea, your lover at
the helm. You belie your own courage when you doubt this
princess’s, my dear heart. For, to say nothing of her trust in me,
which you will own to be bold in any lady (and most bold in herself),
she has the mettle of a blood-horse, whom to stroke is to
sting. She is far gone with child, and you may guess with what
zest, seeing her regard for her partner in it. In truth, she hath a
horror; because her aim is to forget what she can never forgive,
and so every drag upon her leaping spirit seems to remind her of
him and his deeds. Oh, but she suffers and is strong!... I
hear you say to me, ‘Fie, you are bewitched. A spell! A
spell!’—but I laugh at you. There is a still-faced, raven-haired
witch-wife in Liddesdale working upon me under the moon. Aha,
Mistress Sanctity, watch for me o’ nights.</p>

<p>Yestreen the Q. spake of your Serenity. ‘She hates me,’
quoth she, ‘for her father’s sake, in whose cruel disgrace I vow I had
no part; but I shall make her love me yet.’ And when I laughed
somewhat, she gave a thring of the shoulder. ‘I’ld have you
know, Lord Bothwell,’ saith she, ‘that there’s no wife nor bairn
in this land can refuse the kisses of my mouth.’ Thinks I, ‘You
are bold to say it. You may come to crave them.’ <i>Quant à moy,
ma doulce amye, je te bayse les mains.</i></p>

</div>

<p>You can see that he had been laughing at her in the old
way, not boisterously this time, but under the beard, in his
little twinkling eyes; and that, in the old way, she had been
braced by his bravery. He had guessed—you can see that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
too—that she had some need of him, and how necessary it
was that her loathing for her husband should pass into mere
indifference. But he had no notion at that time how pressing
that need was. Not she herself had realised the horror
she had until the night after reaching Dunbar, when the
King, by Standen, had renewed certain proposals, frustrate
before by his laches. It may have been sudden panic, it
may have been a trick of memory—God knows what it
was; but she had flooded with scarlet, then turned dead
white, had murmured some excuse, and with bowed head
and feeble, expostulating hands, had left the room. She
did not come back that night. She had called Des-Essars,
fled with him into the turret, found an empty chamber
under the leads, had the door locked, a great coffer jammed
against it—and had stayed there so till morning. The
young man, writing a word or two upon it, says that she
was almost rigid at first, in a waking trance; and that she
sat ‘pinned to his side’ while the maids and valets hunted
her high and low. ‘I did what I could,’ he writes; ‘talked
nonsense, told old tales, sang saucy songs, which by that
time of my life I had been glad to have forgotten, and,
affecting a nonchalance which I was far from feeling,
recovered her a little. She began to be curious whether
they would find her, judged by the ear how the scent lay,
laughed to hear Mistress Seton panting on the stair, and
Carwood screaming—“There’s a great rat in my road!”
Presently she slept, with her head on my knees and my
jacket over her shoulders. I took her down to bed before
morning, and in the daylight she had partly recovered
herself. She transacted business, ate a meal; but I remarked
that she trembled whenever the King entered the
room, and faltered when she was obliged to reply to him—faltered
and turned up her eyes, as fowls do when they are
sleepy. Fortunately for her, he was sulky, and did not
renew his advances.’</p>

<p>I suspect that she found out—for she was rigid in self-probing—that
if she allowed herself to abhor him for an
unspeakable affront, she would have to scorn herself even
more for having given him the means of affronting her.
Right punishment: she would admit that she had deserved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
it. She had been the basest of women (she would say)
when she offered that which was to her a sacrament, in
barter for mere political advantage. Why, yes! she had
prepared to sell herself to this wallowing swine in order to
escape her prison; and if he snored the bargain out of his
head it was because he was a hog,—but then, O God! what
was she? So, from not daring to think of that night of
shame, she passed to fearing to think of the shameful
recreants in it; and as we ever peer at what we dread, it
came about that she could think of nothing else, and was in
torment. Des-Essars gives none of this; it was not in his
power to get at it; but he saw, what we can never see, that
she suffered atrociously, that her case grew desperate.
Hear him. ‘One day I came with a message to her
chamber door, early; the door was half-open. I had a
shocking vision of her abed, lying there in a bed of torture,
like one stung; on her face, writhing and moaning, tossing
her hands—short breath, tearless sobbing, sharp cries to
God; while Mary Seton read aloud out of Saint-Augustin
by the fog-bound cresset light. She read on through everything—pausing
only to put our Mistress back into the
middle of the bed, for fear lest she might fall out and hurt
herself.’</p>

<p>If this is true—and we know that it is—why, then, out
of such waking delirium, out of anguish so dry, Queen Mary
must have been delivered if she were not to die of it.</p>

<p class="tb">The Earl of Bothwell was not a man of imagination,
though he had a quick fancy. He read his Queen in this
state of hers with interest at first, and some amusement, not
then knowing how dire it was. He saw that she would
turn white and leave any room into which King Darnley
entered; he knew that she would ride far to avoid him, and
sometimes, indeed, under sudden stress, would use whip
and spur and fly from him like a hunted thief. When he
found out something—not very much, for Des-Essars would
not speak—of the events of the night in the turret, moved
by good-nature, he put himself in the way to help her.
He got more maids fetched from Edinburgh—Fleming and Mary
Sempill—and himself stayed with her as long as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
dared, and longer than he cared. And then, one day by
chance, he got a full view of her haunted mind—a field of
broken lights indeed! and saw how far he might travel
there if he chose, and with what profit to himself.</p>

<p>He was with her afoot on the links behind the town—sandy
hillocks of dry bents, and a grey waste at such a
season, abode of the wind and the plovers; he with her,
almost alone. Des-Essars, who walked behind them, had
strayed with the dogs after a hare; the wind, blowing in
from the sea, brought up wisps and patches of fog in which
the boy was hidden. Talking as she went, carelessly, of
the things of France, he listening more or less, she stopped
of a sudden, choked a cry in the throat, and caught at his
arm. ‘Look, look, look!’ she said: ‘what comes this
way?’ He followed the direction of her fixed eyes, and
saw a riderless horse loom out of the vapour, come on
doubtingly at a free trot, shaking his head and snuffing
about him as if he partly believed in his freedom. It
shaped as a great grey Flemish horse, assuredly one of the
King’s.</p>

<p>The Queen began to tremble, to mutter and moan. ‘Oh,
oh, the great horse! Free—it’s free! Oh, if it could be
so! Oh, my lord, oh——I’m afraid!’</p>

<p>‘It is indeed the King’s horse, madam,’ he said. ‘I fear—some
misfortune.’</p>

<p>But she stared at him. ‘Misfortune!’ she cried out.
‘Oh, are you blind? Go and see—go and make sure. I
must be assured—nothing is certain yet. Run, my lord,
run fast!’</p>

<p>He made to obey, and instantly she clung to his arm to
stop him. She was in wild fear.</p>

<p>‘No—no—no—you must not leave me here! There
are voices in the sea-wind—too many voices. A clamour,
a clamour! Those that cry at me through the door, those
that are out on the sea—a many, a many! I tell you I am
afraid.’ Her fear irritated her; she stamped her foot.
‘Do you hear me? I am afraid. You shall not leave me.’</p>

<p>There was no doubt. She was beside herself—looking
all about, her teeth chattering, fingers griping his arm.</p>

<p>‘Why, then, I will send the lad, ma’am,’ says Bothwell.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
‘You need have no fear with me. I hear no voices in the
wind.’</p>

<p>She looked at him wonderfully. ‘Do you never hear
them at night?’ Then her eyes paled, and the pupils
dwindled to little specks of black. ‘Come with me,’ she
said in whisper, ‘a-tiptoe; come softly with me. We must
find him—we can never be sure till we see him lying.
There is one way: you lift the eyelids. Better than a
mirror to the nose. Come, come: I must look at him, to
be very sure.’ She stared into the white sky, and gave a
sudden gasp, pointing outwards while her eyes searched his
face. ‘Look!’ she said: ‘the birds over there. They are
about him already. Come, we shall be too late.’ She led
him away in a feverish hurry, through bush and briar,
talking all the time. ‘Blood on his face—on his mouth
and shut hands. He gripped his dagger by the blade, and
it bit to the bone. He comes and cries at my door—all foul
from his work—and asks me let him in. But I hold it—I
am very strong. He always comes—but now!’ She
laughed insanely, and gave a skip in the air. ‘O come, my
lord—hurry, hurry!’</p>

<p>The loose horse had trotted gaily by them as the
astonished Lord Bothwell followed where he was haled.
Presently, however, he heard another sound, and pulled
back to listen to it. ‘Hearken a moment,’ says he. ‘Yes,
yes! I thought as much. Here comes another horse—galloping
like a fiend—a ridden horse.’</p>

<p>She started, forced herself to listen, knew the truth.
‘He is hunting! Take me—hide me—keep me safe!
Bothwell, keep him off me!’</p>

<p>She knew not what she said or did; but he, full of pity
now, drew her behind a clump of whims and held her with
his arm.</p>

<p>‘There, there, madam, comfort yourself,’ he said.
‘None shall harm you that harm not me first. How
shall you be hurt if you are not to be seen? Trust yourself
to me.’</p>

<p>She shook in his arm like a man in an ague; uncontrollable
fits of shaking possessed her, under which, as
they passed through her, she shut her eyes, and with bent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
head endured them. So much she suffered that, if he had
not let his wits go to work, he would have hailed the King
as he went pounding by. He supposed that she had been
shocked mad by that late business of hasty blood. Of
course he was wrong, but the guess was enough to prevent
him following his first purpose, and so killing her outright.</p>

<p>The King came rocking down the brae, red and furious,
intent upon the truant horse; and as he went, Bothwell
made bold to glance at the Queen. What he saw in her
hag-ridden face was curious enough to set him thinking
hard; curious, but yet, as he saw it, unmistakable. There
was vacancy there, the inability to reason which troubles
the mentally afflicted; there were despair and misery,
natural enough if the poor lady was going mad—and knew
it. But—oh, there was no doubt of it!—there was in the
drawn lines of her face blank, undisguised disappointment.
He saw it all now. She had believed him dead, her heart
had leaped; and now she had just seen him alive, galloping
his horse. Clang goes the cage door again upon my lady!
Now, here was a state of things!</p>

<p>When the King was out of sight and hearing, swallowed
in the growing fog, and she a little recovered, and a little
ashamed, he began to talk with her; and in time she
listened to what he had to say. He spoke well, neither
forgetting the respect due to her, which before he had been
prone to do, nor that due to himself as a man of the world.
He did not disguise from her that he thought very lightly
of David’s killing.</p>

<p>‘Saucy servants, in my opinion,’ he said, ‘must take
what they deserve if they expect more than they are worth.
They demand equality—well, and when they meet gentlemen
with daggers, they get it.’ But he hastened to add
that to have killed the fellow before her face must have
been the act of beasts or madmen—‘and, saving his respect,
madam, your consort was one and your Ruthven the
other.’</p>

<p>To his great surprise she then said quietly that she was
of the same mind, and not greatly afflicted by the deed, or
the manner of it either. She had seen men killed in France;
queens should be blooded as well as hounds. She also considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
that Davy had been presumptuous. He had known
his aptitudes too well. But useful he had certainly been,
and she intended to have another out of the same nest—Joseph,
his brother. Singular lady! she had found time
to write into Piedmont for him.</p>

<p>‘Well then, madam,’ says Bothwell, with a shrug, ‘all
this being your true mind, I own myself at a loss how to
take your extreme alarms.’</p>

<p>She bit her lip. ‘I am better. Maybe they were
foolish. Who knows? I cannot tell you any more than
this. I had nearly forgot that wicked deed. But there are
other offences—women find—which cannot, can never be
forgotten.’ She grew impatient. ‘Ah, but it is not tolerable
to discuss such things.’</p>

<p>Even then he did not know what she meant. She had
been mortally offended by the King, and offended to the
point of horror—but by something worse than murder and
strife in the chamber, by something which she could not
speak of! What under Heaven had that red-faced, stable-legged
lad in him which could terrify her?</p>

<p>‘Madam,’ he said, ‘if you cannot talk of it, you cannot
tell it me, and there is an end. My counsel to you is this:
put the young lord and his sottishness out of your royal
head. Look at him stoutly and aver that he is naught.
You have shown that you can face a rebel kingdom;
face now your rebel heart. For I say that your heart is
a rebel against your head, swerving and backing like a jade
that needs the spur. Ride your heart, madam! Ply whip
to the flanks, bring it up to the boggart in the corn. Thus
only your heart shall nose out the empty truth. Why,
good lack! what is there to credit all your alarm but silly
fed flesh and seething liquor? Look at him, judge him,
flick your fingers at him, and forget him. Madam, I speak
freely.’</p>

<p>She said faintly that he was very right. She had
suffered much of late in all ways: she spoke of pains in
the side, in the head, of fancies at night, etc. She owned
that she desired his good opinion of her courage, and promised
she would try to earn it. Looking tired and ill,
smiling as if she knew only too well there was no smiling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
matter, she held out her hand to him at the entry of the
town. He bowed over and kissed it. Mildly she thanked
him and went her ways with Des-Essars.</p>

<p>He wrote to the countess soon after:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Very strange matters chance here daily, of the which I write
not exactly for fear of misreading. One thing I plainly understand,
the K. shall never more prosper here. While he was
beloved he was something, and when he was dreaded he was
much; but now that he comes and goes unnoticed he is nothing
at all. And so he will remain, I suppose, until the lying-in,
which will be in June coming they say. Ill betide him then if,
when she is reminded of him in his son, he play her any trick. I
would not give a snap of the finger and thumb for his life. We
are for Edinburgh on Monday morn, whence look infallibly for
my tidings.</p>

</div>

<p>The King, then, was nothing at all. Nerved by her
brawny councillor, she had faced her ‘boggart in the corn,’
and in two days’ time could curl her fine lip to remember
him. That is a proof that she was sane at the root, needing
no more than such bitter as his rough tongue could
give to restore her tone. And, having ridded her fears,
she soon found that she could rid her memory altogether.
The King went out and in, as Bothwell had written, unnoticed.
He made no more attempts to come at her,
spoke to none but his own company, felt that he was in
disgrace, and sulked. Lord Bothwell scoffed at him by
implication—by every keen shaft from his eyes and every
wag of his head; Lord Huntly kept at a distance; Sir
James altered his salutation. On the Sunday before they
should move back to town they were speaking of the rebel
lords, whether they were now in England or yet on the
road; and Bothwell began to cry up Ruthven, his madness,
his knives, his friends’ knives. The King got up and
left the table. He told Standen afterwards that he should
not go to Edinburgh. Standen told Des-Essars, and he
told the Queen.</p>

<p>‘Oh, but he shall,’ she said at once, consulted her
friends, and sent him a verbal message that she should
need him there. He felt this badly—but obeyed it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>For, much against her inclination, she had made up her
mind that she must drag the chain which had been forged
upon her; she must keep the King in her eye for fear he
should work her a mischief. His father Lennox was in
Glasgow, an escaped enemy: it would never do for him to
go thither. Or suppose he were to return to England!
No, no, she must keep him in Edinburgh, keep him cowed,
and yet not allow him to grow desperate. Worse than
that, the time was coming on when she must have him by
her side, in the house, perhaps nearer still. He was now
‘the Queen’s dearest Consort,’ but soon he would be ‘the
Prince’s dearest father’ and a power in the land. The
Earl of Bothwell, consulted, was precise about that—awkwardly
precise.</p>

<p>‘Folk will talk, madam, about you and him. He’ll not
want for a faction to cry, “The King keeps aloof! Well
he may, knowing what he knows.” Oh, have him with
you, ma’am, as near as may be. For hawks dinna pick
out hawks’ een, as they say; and if he owns to the child—why,
he should know his own.’</p>

<p>She flushed. ‘You speak too plainly, my lord.’</p>

<p>‘Not if I mean honestly, ma’am.’</p>

<p>‘I hope you mean so,’ said she, ‘but the sound of your
phrase is otherwise.’</p>

<p>‘I was speaking in character, ma’am. Mark that.’</p>

<p>She was looking down at her lap when next she spoke,
carelessly at her careless fingers. ‘Whose child do they
allege it?’</p>

<p>The directness of the question and indirectness of its
manner puzzled him. He could not tell whether to be
blunt or fine.</p>

<p>‘Madam, I am no scandal-monger, I hope, and have
little pleasure in the grunting of hogs in a sty. But hogs
will grunt, as your Majesty knows.’</p>

<p>She did not raise her eyes, but said: ‘It will be better
that you answer me in a few words. One will suffice.’</p>

<p>He tried—he began—but could not do it. ‘Madam,’
he said, ‘you must answer for yourself. All I will ask is
this: what, think you, drew the King to the deed he did?’</p>

<p>She lifted her head and gave him one long look.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
Rather, it seemed long. He knelt down quickly and
kissed her knee.</p>

<p>He rose and began to justify himself. ‘You forced me
to say it—it may have been my duty—make it not my
offence. God knows I needed no such royal answer as
you have given me—not I! I think no evil of your
Majesty, nor have I ever.’</p>

<p>She flashed her eyes upon him—not angrily by any
means. ‘Oh, my lord, may I be sure of that? Come, I
will tell you what I seem to remember. There was a day
when you enlarged yourself from my prison and rode, a
free man, to Haddington. What said you of me there
among your friends?’</p>

<p>He puzzled over this. ‘I can charge myself with
nothing. Your Grace knows more of me than I do.’</p>

<p>‘Did you not speak in the hearing of one Pringle concerning
me and my uncle the Cardinal? Did you give me
a name then? Come, come, my lord, be plain. Did you
not?’</p>

<p>He burst out laughing. ‘The voice is the voice of
Queen Mary, but the words are of Black James Stuart!
Oho, madam, you will hear finer tales than this concerning
me, if you sound that thoughtful man.’</p>

<p>She pressed him, but he would neither deny nor affirm.
‘I shall not defend myself, madam, before your Majesty.
But I will meet the Earl of Moray, and wager him in
battle, if you give me leave: in battle of one and one, or
of a score, or of ten score. Let him repeat his charge in
the Grassmarket if he dare.’</p>

<p>Baffled here, she harped back upon the child. She said
that she needed to be sure of his good opinion of her.
Then he made her heart beat fast, for he came and put his
hand upon the back of her chair and stood right over her:
she could feel the strength of his eyes, like beams from the
sun, driving down upon her.</p>

<p>‘Madam, and my sovereign lady, as God is my judge,
this is the truth. I loved you once, and, at love’s bidding,
staked all on a great design. My plot was unmannerly,
but so is love; you were offended with me, as your right
was. I loved you no less, but honoured you the more,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
because of that. If now I thought evil of you—such evil
as you suspect in me—I would tell you so for the sake
of that love I gave you before.’</p>

<p>She bowed her head and thanked him humbly; did not
look up, nor stir from her place below him.</p>

<p>‘As meek as a mouse!’—he could not remember ever
to have seen her so before. What was in her heart? It
sent him away thoughtful. Next day he rode at her side
to Edinburgh.</p>

<p class="tb">Established there more firmly than at any time since
her reign began; with a council packed with her friends,
with Lord Huntly (her slave) for Chancellor; with her
open enemies ruined and in exile, her secret enemies abject
at her knees, her husband in disgrace, and her child near
its birth—in this comfortable state of her affairs, the Earl
of Bothwell suddenly asked leave to go into his own
country. She was piqued, and could not help showing it.</p>

<p>‘You desire to—you will consort with—one who loves
me little? Well, my lord, well! How should I hinder
your going, since I cannot quench your desire?’</p>

<p>Thinks he, ‘Now, now, what root of grievance is this,
sprouting here?’ Aloud he said, ‘Madam, I am content—and
more than content—to stay by your Majesty so
long as you find me of use. But the time is at hand, and
you have said it, when you will refuse me harbourage.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, yes,’ she said quickly, her face aflame: ‘you
cannot be with me in the castle.’</p>

<p>She had agreed to lie-in there, and had forbidden
quarters to Lords Bothwell and Huntly alike. Do you
ask why? Mary Seton might have answered you in part—but
scornfully, since women have no need to ask such
things. They know them. ‘Lord Huntly! Lord Huntly!’
I can hear her say—a pretty, vehement little creature—‘Lord
Huntly! And he a known lover of our mistress?
How should he be there?’ Pass Lord Huntly: what of
Lord Bothwell? She would shake her head. ‘No, no,’
she would say, ‘it could not be. He is a faithful friend.’
Well, then, what of that? She would rise quickly and
walk to the window. ‘I cannot tell you, sir, why he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
not to be there. But I am very clear that she would not
suffer it. Oh, for example——impossible!’ You would
get no more from her. And what more could you want?</p>

<p>But the Queen was still frowning over his leave of
absence, and pinching her lip. Then she broke out, in
the midst of her private thoughts: ‘But I cannot refuse
you! How can I? You having asked to go—what is the
worth of your staying, when your heart is——And yet—there
is the King——’ She looked slily up. ‘My lord,
do you dare to trust your pupil alone?’</p>

<p>His face took a gay air. ‘If I am your tutor,
madam——’</p>

<p>‘Why,’ said she, ‘what else can you be? My confessor?
My cousin? My brother? What else?’</p>

<p>He laughed, avoiding her inquiry. ‘To be your brother
would be to own kinship with my lord of Moray. A
dangerous degree, ma’am, for one of the pair.’</p>

<p>‘I would not have you for my brother,’ she said
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Responsive thought struck fire in his eyes. ‘I will ask
you this. Will your Grace receive me into the castle?
There I could be of service—maybe.’</p>

<p>He watched her intently now—watched until he saw
the flag come fluttering down. She lowered her eyes; he
could hardly hear her words.</p>

<p>‘No, no. You must not be there. Afterwards—come
soon.’ She waited there, hanging on the last word; then
rose. ‘Yes,’ she said, ‘it is better that you should go.
I will not——’ She spoke wildly. ‘Go, my lord, go.’</p>

<p>He knelt to her before he obeyed; at the door she
called him back. Quickly he returned, but she would not
look at him.</p>

<p>‘I wish to tell you—as plainly as I can——’ So she
began, speaking slowly, feeling for her words. ‘The King
shall be there with me—in the castle. It is painful to me—I
conceive that you must know it. But I shall do as
you advise—that scandal may be averted.’ She strained
her arms down, stiffening them, gave an impatient shake
of the head. ‘Heaven watch over me! And you, my
lord, do you pray. Ah, but you use not prayer!’ She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
seemed conscious that she was speaking double and he
not understanding. It made her angry enough to look at
him. ‘Well, well, why are you here still? Go quickly, I
say—go.’</p>

<p>Go he did, a puzzling, excited man.</p>

<p>Before he left the city he saw his brother-in-law, Lord
Huntly, for a moment. ‘Geordie,’ he said, ‘I’m for the
Border. I’m going to my wife. Are you for yours or do
you stay here?’</p>

<p>‘I stay.’</p>

<p>‘You may be wise. I am going to my wife—and I
may be wise. God knows that I know not. I have not
seen her for five months.’</p>

<p>Lord Huntly had no answer. He had not seen his
for over a year. Presently Bothwell makes another cast.</p>

<p>‘I took leave of the Queen of late. She was greatly
wrought upon—distempered. Sent me off—called me
back—sent me off again, after some wild words. I know
not what to make of it.’</p>

<p>‘Help her through it, God!’ said Huntly.</p>

<p>‘I think it is a matter for Lucina,’ said Bothwell, and
went his road.</p>

<p>He travelled musingly by the hill-ways into Liddesdale,
French Paris behind him. At the top of the pass—Note
o’ the Gate, they call it—whence first you see the brown
valley of the Liddel, and all the hills, quiet guardians
about the silver water, he reined up, and stood looking
over his lands.</p>

<p>‘Yonder awaits me the fairest dark lady in Scotland,
and (to my mind) the fairest demesne: the open country
and the good red deer. Oh, the bonny holms, the green
knowes, and the ledged rocks! Houp, man! We are
free of the scented chambers and all their whisperings
here.’</p>

<p>‘It is most certain, my lord,’ said French Paris, ‘that
we have left the direction of those whisperings to Monsieur
de Moray.’</p>

<p>Lord Bothwell was stung. ‘Monsieur de Moray!
Monsieur de Moray! Pooh, rascal, she has her husband
with her now. And that may be even worse for me.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>French Paris looked demurely at the reins sliding in
his fingers. ‘True, my lord, she has his Majesty. I
have remarked that women in the Queen’s condition
have extraordinary inclination for their husbands. It is
reasonable.’</p>

<p>‘You are a fool, Paris,’ said the Earl.</p>

<p>But when he was at Hermitage, his proud wife upon
his knee, my lord swore to himself over and over again
that he was the happiest rogue not yet hanged. And yet
he could not but hear, beneath all his protestations, that
slow, wounded voice,—‘Afterwards—come soon.’ Good
lord! what was the meaning of the like of that?</p>

<h3 id="II_CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="smaller">THE WASHING OF HANDS</span></h3>

<p>To a woman’s affair flocked matron and maid, till the castle
seemed a hive of rock-bees. Afar off, it was said, you
could hear them humming within; on sudden alarms out
they came in a swarm, and ill fared physician or priest, or
discreet, wide-eared gentleman sent by his wife to get a
piece of news. June was in and well in, skies were clean,
the twilight long in coming and loth to go. Queen Mary
lay idle by her window, and watched the red roofs turn
purple, the hills grow black, the paling of the light from
yellow to green, the night’s solemn gathering-in, the star
shine clear in a dark-blue bed out there over Arthur’s Seat.
Her time was short—but one could scarcely tell. She
often felt that she scarcely cared to tell when this crowning
hour was to come.</p>

<p>Quick-spirited, sanguine young woman, she bade fair to
be weary of matron and maid alike, with their everlasting
talk of ‘the promise of Scotland,’ their midwifery stories,
their nods and winks, their portentous cares over what she
had supposed a pretty ordinary business. It was to be seen
that she was fretting, and the truth was that she was in
much too good health: bodily ease had never been pleasant
to her, and never been safe. Her mind grew arrogant and
luxurious at once, felt itself free to range in regions unlawful;
and so did range, the lax flesh playing courier. So
while the humming and swarming of the household bees
went on over and about her listless head, while she snapped
twice at the maids for every once the matrons chafed her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
in her mind she walked where she fain would have had her
body to be: and then, sick of this futility, she grew peevish
and wished she had never been born. Upon such a crisis,
intending for the best, Mary Beaton superinduced a stout,
easily-flushed, gamesome lady, her aunt Lady Forbes
of Reres.</p>

<p>Mary Beaton was now the wife of Mr. Ogilvy of Boyne;
but this aunt of hers was of the father’s side. A Beaton,
she, niece of the great murdered cardinal, sister of the
witch-wife of Buccleuch, and in these, no less than in her
own respects, a lady to be aware of. She was in her days
of silver and russet now, who before may have been of
dangerous beauty—of that quickly-ripe, drowsy, blowsy,
Venetian sort, disastrous to mankind. Of it, indeed, the
clear ravages remained, though cushioned deep in comfortable
flesh; traceable there, as in the velvety bosses of a
green hill you mark the contours of what was once a citadel
of war. Her grey hair she now wore over her ears, to
conceal (as the Queen averred) members which were so
well stuffed with gallant lore as to be independent for the
rest of their lives. She had a pretty mouth—a little overhung—and
dimpled chin, light green eyes, fat, pleasurable
hands, a merry voice and a railing tongue. Thanks to the
combination, she could be malicious without ceasing to
amuse. To those who know—and by this time I hope they
are many—it is good evidence of her abilities and merits
alike that Mary Livingstone could not abide the woman.</p>

<p>It was not required that she should. The Queen, too
languid to judge her, listened to the savoury tales of this
Reres by the hour together, neither laughing nor chuckling,
but for all that fully content. So one might watch
audacious archery, and admire the barbed flights, even
when some pricked oneself. Lady Reres was of that kind
of woman who can never speak of men without marking
the gender of them. All the persons on her scene wore
transparent draperies; to hear her you would have supposed
that the one business of man were to pursue his
helpmate, and of woman to stroke her own beauties. She
spared neither age nor sex from her categories: all must
be stuffed in somewhere; nor did the very throne exempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
the sitter from service. The throne of Scotland, for
instance! She made it sufficiently appear to Queen Mary
that her royal father had been a mighty hunter. She
knew the romantic origin of all the by-blows—‘Cupid’s
trophies,’ as she called them (O my Lord of Moray!)—and
did not scruple to reveal them to the ears of Lady Argyll,
herself the daughter of Margaret Erskine, and quite aware
of it. Then she must adventure Queen Marie of Lorraine—the
one saint whose lamp had never grown dim upon
her daughter’s altar—and hint that she had been consciously
fair and not unconsciously pursued. ‘And I speak
as one who should know, sweet madam,’ said this old
Reres; ‘for the Cardinal, fine man, was of my own kindred,
and differed noways from the rest of the men. I mind
very well—’twas at Linlithgow, where you were born, my
Queen—Queen Marie sat by the window on a day, her
hand at her side, at her foot a dropped rose. But oh!
that flower was wan beside the roses in her face. Your
Majesty hath not her hues—no, but you favour the Stuarts.
“Dear sakes, madam,” say I, “you have dropped your
rose.” So faintly as she smiled, I heard her sigh, and
knew she could not answer me then. “Some one will pick
up what I have let fall,” saith she at last—and then, behind
the curtain, I see a red shoe. I touched my lips—they
were as red as your own in those days, madam—and
slipped away, knowing my book. Hey! but red was the
hue of the Court at that tide—with the tall Cardinal, and
the tall rosy Queen, and the dropping, dropping roses.’
The Queen let her talk. She had a soft, wheedling voice—a
murmurous accompaniment to luxurious thought.</p>

<p>No doubt, when the body is unstrung you pet your
thought, and indulge it in its wanton ways. There is no
harm in dreaming. The Queen lay waiting there, thrilled
faintly with the sense of what was to come upon her, softly
served and softly lapped. And in soft guise came into
ministry the figures of her dreams, inviting, craving, imploring,
grieving, clinging about her. She communed again
with all her lovers, the highest and the lowest—from
Charles of France, Most Christian King, a stormy boy,
who frowned his black brows upon her and kissed so hotly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
on that day she saw him last, down to slim, grey-eyed
Jean-Marie-Baptiste, whom by kindness she had made
man. Others there were, stored in her mind, a many and
a many—and any one of them would have died for her
once. What of Mr. Knox, of the great hands? What of
John Gordon, fiercest of old Huntly’s sons? What of
George Gordon, romantic, speechless lover at this hour?
To each his own sweetness, to each the secret of his own
desire: she savoured each by each as she lay, turning and
snuggling and dreaming among her pillows. And when
the cooing old Reres by the bed spoke of Lord Bothwell,
she listened, sharply intent; and wondered if there were
light enough left to betray her, and hoped not. Dangerous,
desperate, hardy man! He was a theme upon which
Lady Reres descanted at large. Let his draperies be as
they would, his gender was never in doubt.</p>

<p>Reres had known James Bothwell—so she always called
him—for many years; for although his only numbered
thirty yet, and she confessed to five-and-forty, he had come
into blossom as quick as a pear-tree in a mild Lent: at
fifteen and a half James Bothwell——! She lifted up her
hands to end the sentence.</p>

<p>‘They say—under the breath I speak it—that of late
he hath cast his eyes above him. Ah, and how high above
him, and how saucily, let others tell your Majesty.’ Queen
Mary’s hot ears needed no telling. ‘They say it drove
my lord of Arran into raving fits. Fie then, and out
upon you, Bothwell, if Majesty cannot be a hedge about
a lovely woman! But so it hath ever been with all that
disordered blood of Hepburn: thieves all, all thieving
greatly. I need not go back far—and yet they tell the
tale of the first Hepburn of them, and of Queen Joan,
widow of our first James. What did those two at Dunbar
together?’ At Dunbar—a Hepburn and a dead Queen of
Scots—alack! and what had done this living Queen with
her Hepburn there?</p>

<p>‘A pest upon them all!’ cries Reres; ‘for what did the
son of that Hepburn with a Queen? And the father of
our James Bothwell, what did he? For if James Bothwell’s
father loved not your Majesty’s own mother, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
loved her not in vain—why should our man find himself
a straitened earl at this day? But so it is, they say, and so
is like to be, that every Hepburn of Bothwell dieth for
love of a Queen of Scots. Foh, then! and is our man to
vary the tide of his race? Oh, madam, I could tell your
Majesty some deal of his prowess! Listen now: he loved
my sister Buccleuch, and me he loved. Greedy, greedy!
Oh, there’s a many and many a woman hath greeted sore
for him to come back. But he never came, my Queen of
Honey, he never came! And let not her,’ she darkly said,
‘that hath him now, think to keep him. No, no, the
turtle hath mated too high. He is like the king-eagle
that sits lonely on his rock, and fears not look at the sun:
for why? he bideth the time when he may choose to fly
upward. Did he mate with my sister—a Hob to her Jill?
Mated he with me? God knows whom he will mate with
or mate not. He has but to ask and have, I think.’</p>

<p>‘Pull the curtain, pull the curtain,’ says Queen Mary;
‘the light vexes my eyes.’</p>

<p>‘And stings your fair cheek, my Honey-Queen,’ says
wise Lady Reres, and gives her a happy kiss.</p>

<p>So it is that a woman of experience, who carries her
outlay gallantly, approves herself to her junior, who wishes
to carry her own as gallantly as may be. But Mary
Livingstone—Mistress Sempill, as they called her now—mother
already and hoping to be mother again, used to
bounce out of the bedchamber whenever Lady Reres
entered it with her James Bothwell on the tip of her quick
tongue.</p>

<p class="tb">In the drowsy days of mid-June the Queen suffered and
bare a son. First to know it outside the castle-hive was
brisk Sir James Melvill, who had it from Mary Beaton
before they fired the guns on the platform; and that same
night, by the soaring lights of the bonfires, rode out of
Lothian to carry the great news into England. No man
saw Queen Mary for four days, though the castle was
filled to overflowing and the Earl of Huntly walked all
night about the courtyards, telling himself that for the
sake of mother and child the vile father must be kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
alive. The King was lodged in the castle by now; and
one good reason for Huntly’s vigil may have been that
his Majesty and his people had swamped the house-room.
The Earls of Moray, Argyll and Mar were there; Atholl
also and Crawfurd (to name no more)—the two last linked
with Huntly against two of the first, and all alike watching
Lord Moray for a sign. It seemed, now this child was
come, no man knew just what line he should take. So
each looked doubtfully at his neighbour, and an eye of
each was linked to Moray’s eyes of mystery. At the end
of her four days’ grace the Queen sent for her brothers
first among men—the three black Stuarts, James, John,
and Robert; and two of them obeyed her.</p>

<p>In the dark, faint-smelling chamber, as they knelt about
her bed, she put her thin hand over the edge that they
might kiss it, and seemed touched that they should do it
with such reverence. They could see her fixed eyes—large
now, and all black—upon them, seeking, wondering,
considering if their homage might be real. As if no
answer was to be read out of them, she sighed and turned
away her head. She spoke faintly, in the voice of a
woman too tired to be disheartened. ‘You shall see
your Prince, my lords. Fetch me in the Prince.’</p>

<p>The child was brought in upon a cushion, a mouthing,
pushing, red epitome of our pretensions, with a blind
pitiful face. Lady Mar and Lady Reres held it between
them, passed it elaborately under the review of the lords;
and as these looked upon it in the way men use, as if
timid to admit relationship with a thing so absurd—here
is a James Stuart to be taken, and that other left!—the
Queen watched them with bitter relish, turned to be a
cynic now, for the emptiness of disenchantment was upon
her. To win this mock-reverence of theirs she had
laboured and spent! With this, O God, she had paid a
price! Now let all go: for they looked at her prize as at
so much puling flesh, and had kissed her hand on the
same valuation. Pish! they would scheme and plot and
lie over the son as they had over the mother—and the only
honest fellow in all Scotland was Death, who had just
made a fool of her! The child began to wail for its nurse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
and pricked her into a dry heat. For it is to be known
that she could not nurse her baby. ‘Take him, take him,
good Reres. I cannot bear the noise he makes, nor can
ease him any. And you, my lords, shall come again if
you will. Come when the King is by.’ Here, as if
suddenly urged by some anxiety, she raised herself in the
bed. They saw how white she was, and how fearfully in
earnest. ‘Fail me not, brothers, in this. I desire you to
be with me when the King is here.’</p>

<p>When they had both promised, they left her to sleep;
but she could get none for fretting and tossing about.</p>

<p>Mary Livingstone said, How could she sleep? She
was ‘woeful that she could not nurse her baby.’</p>

<p>Hereat the Queen took her by the arm and hurt her
by her vehemence. ‘What honesty is left in this world but
Death?’ she croaked in her misery. ‘When your blood-brothers
compass your downfall, and your husband is a
liar declared, and your own breasts play churl to your
new-born child—oh, oh, oh, I would open my arms to
bonny leman Death!’</p>

<p>Mary Livingstone, blind with tears, hung over her, but
could not speak. The Queen drove her away, and had in
the reminiscent, the caustic, the fertile Reres.</p>

<p>At two in the afternoon of a later day a great company
was admitted; and the King, coming in last with an
Englishman of his friends, stood for the first time these
long weeks by the Queen’s bed. She was prepared for
him, gave him her hand, but flinched evidently when he
saluted it. The Countess of Mar brought in the Prince,
having settled this function of honour with Reres as best
she knew, and handed it about in the throng.</p>

<p>‘Give it to me, my Lady Mar,’ says the Queen in that
dry, whispering voice of hers. All the spring seemed gone
out of her, so much she dragged her words. The
moment she had it in bed with her it began its feeble
wailing.</p>

<p>‘There, sir, there then! ’Tis your royal Mother has
you!’ says Lady Mar; and the Queen, bothered and sick
of the business before she had begun with it, grew deadly
hot as she held it, rocking it about. The King gazed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
solemnly at his offspring: he blinked, but no more foolishly
than any other man. The courtiers admired, happily not
called upon to speak; in fact, nobody spoke except the
infant, and Lady Mar, who pleaded in whispers. Nor did
she whisper in vain, for presently the crying stopped, the
Queen held up the child in her arms and searched vaguely
the King’s face. I say, vaguely, because those who knew
and loved her best could not in the least understand that
questioning look, nor connect it with the words she spoke.
She used no form of ceremony, neither sir’d nor my-lorded
him; but poring blankly in his face, ‘God hath given you
and me a son,’ she said.</p>

<p>The King was observed to blush. ‘And I thank God
for him, madam,’ was his answer, as he stooped to kiss the
child. He achieved his honourable purpose, though the
Queen drew back as his face came near. Who did not see
that?</p>

<p>Again she said, ‘You have kissed your very son.’ There
was a silence upon all, and then she added in a voice
aside—‘So much your son that I fear it will be the worse
for him hereafter.’ Coming at such a time, from such a
mouth, the words dropped upon that hushed assembly like
an Oracle. No Scot of them all durst say anything, nor
could the French Ambassador find phrases convenient.
The King may or may not have heard her—he was slow.
But plain Sir William Stanley in his Lancashire voice
cried out, ‘God save your Majesties, and the Prince your
son!’ She looked about to find who spoke so heartily,
and they told her the name and station of the man.
She observed him with interest, held up the child for
him to see.</p>

<p>‘Look upon him, sir, for whom you pray so stoutly. This
is the prince I hope shall first unite two realms.’</p>

<p>‘Why, madam,’ says Sir William, ‘shall he succeed
before your Majesty and his father?’</p>

<p>He meant well, but did unhappily. The Queen gave
back the child to Lady Mar before she replied.</p>

<p>Then, ‘Yes,’ she said, ‘I think he shall, and for this
reason. Because his father has broken my heart.’</p>

<p>Not a soul dared to move. The King started—as one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
jerks in first sleep—grew violently red, looked from face
to face, found no friendliness in any, and broke out desperately:
‘Is this your promise? Is this your promise?
To forget and forgive?’</p>

<p>She was as hard as flint. ‘I have forgiven,’ she said,
‘but I shall never forget. Would that I could! But what
if I had died that snowy night? Or what if Fawdonsyde’s
pistol had shot my babe in me?’</p>

<p>‘Madam,’ said the King, ‘these things are past.’</p>

<p>She threw herself back, face to the wall. ‘Ay, they
are past. Well, let them go.’ She shut her eyes resolutely
until they were all gone out; and when that, which
seemed the only thing to be done, was well done, she
opened them again, with a new and sharp outlook upon
affairs. She sent one of the women for Des-Essars,
another for the physician.</p>

<p>To this latter, who found her sitting up in bed with very
bright eyes, she said, ‘Master Physician, I feel stronger,
having done all the disagreeable duties which seemed
expected of me. I wish for your consideration of this
matter: when can I rise from this bed?’</p>

<p>He gravely pondered. ‘Madam, in these heats I dare
not advise you to be moved. Nourishment and repose
should work wonders for your Majesty, as indeed you
tell me that they have.’</p>

<p>‘At least, they would if I could get them,’ she replied.</p>

<p>‘All Scotland would give herself to provide them,
madam, for your solace.’</p>

<p>‘They are the last things I should look for from Scotland,’
said the Queen. ‘Nourishment and repose! I shall
leave my bed to-morrow.’</p>

<p>‘Madam,’ said the doctor, ‘I have but done my duty.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, duty!’ she said. ‘And have I not done mine?
Now, good sir, I intend my pleasure.’</p>

<p>Dismissing him, she turned to Des-Essars, who stood
erect by the door. ‘I desire to wash my hands, Jean-Marie.
Bring basin and towel.’</p>

<p>As he served her at the bed’s edge, she dipped and
rinsed her hands—carefully, formally, smiling to herself
as at the good performance of some secret rite. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
might have been lustral water, Jordan’s, or that sluggish
flow of Lethe’s. She held up her wet hands before the
lad’s face. ‘Do you see any speck?’</p>

<p>‘Oh no, madam.’</p>

<p>‘Be very sure,’ she said; ‘look well again. These
hands, mark you, have been in Scotland four years.’ She
rinsed again and wrung them of drops; smelt them, and
seemed pleased. ‘Roses they smell of now—not Scotland,’
she said. ‘So I am free of Scotland.’ She dried her
hands and sent him away with the service—‘But come
back soon,’ she said; ‘I have more for you to do.’</p>

<p>Des-Essars returned. ‘Wait you there,’ said she,
‘while I write a letter.’ She wrote, pausing here and
there, looking wisely for a word or two—sometimes at
the prim-faced youth, as if she could find one there—scoring
out, underlining, smiling, biting the pen. She
ended—did not re-read.</p>

<p>‘Bring taper and wax.’ She sealed her letter with her
signet ring, and held it out. ‘Take this incontinent to my
lord of Bothwell. At Hermitage in Liddesdale you shall
find him. Be secret and sure. You have never failed me
yet, and I trust you more than most. I trusted you four
years ago, when you were a boy: now you are nearly a
man, and shall prove to be fully one if you do this errand
faithfully. Ask for French Paris at your first coming in—thus
you will get at my lord privily. Now go, remembering
how much I entrust you with—my happiness, and hope,
and honour.’ He made to leave her, but she cried, ‘Stay.
You love me, I think. Come nearer—come very near.
Nearer, nearer, foolish boy. What, are you so timid?
Now—stoop down and kiss me here.’ She touched her
cheek, then offered it.</p>

<p>He flushed up to the roots of his hair and had nothing
to say; but he was never one to refuse chances. She said,
‘You have kissed a Queen. Now go, and earn your wages.’
He marched from the room, grown man, and took the way
in half an hour.</p>

<p>At his castle of Hermitage, deep in the hills, the Earl of
Bothwell frowned over his letter, and having read it many
times, went on frowning as he fingered it. ‘Now, if any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
faith might be given to a princess,’ he thought to himself,
‘those two should never be together again man and wife.
The pledge is here, the written word.’ He chuckled low
in his throat, then shrugged like an Italian. ‘The word
of a prince, the bond of a weathercock! Let the words go
for words—but the heart that devised, the head that spun,
the hand that set them here—ah, a man may count on
them!’ He sprang to his feet, went to the window and
looked out far into the sunny brown hills. He shook his
fist at the blue sky. ‘Oh, Bastard of Scotland, James misbegotten
of James! Oh, my man, if these words are true,
there shall come a grapple between you and me such as
the men of the dales know not—and a backthrow for one
of us, man James, which shall not be for me.’ Leaning
out of the window, he roared into the court for his men.
‘Ho, Hob Elliott! Ho, Jock Scott! Armstrong, Willy
Pringle, Paris, you French thief! Boot and saddle, you
dogs of war—I take the North road this night.’ He strode
a turn or more about the room, shaking his letter in his
hand. ‘Better than a charter, better than a sasine, bond
above bonds!’</p>

<p>But he went to his wife’s bower. ‘My heart,’ saith he,
‘I must leave thee this night—I am called to town. God
knoweth the end of the adventure. Read, my soul, read,
and then advise.’</p>

<p>She read the French slowly, he behind her, his face
almost touching her cheek, prompting her with a word or
two; but so eager as he was, he was always in front, and
had to come back for her, mastering his impatience. At the
end she sat quietly, looking at her hands. His excitement
was not to be borne.</p>

<p>‘Well, my girl, well?’</p>

<p>‘Go to her, my lord.’</p>

<p>‘You say that!’</p>

<p>She replied calmly, ‘No, it is she that says it—it is
veiled in these lines.’</p>

<p>He took her face between his hands. ‘But it is thou
that sendest me—hey? Be very sure now what thou art
about. If I go, I go to the end. I stay never when I ride
out o’ nights until I have the cattle in byre.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>Her deep eyes met his without faltering. ‘Let her have
of you what she will. I have what I have.’</p>

<p>Now she had made him wary. He could not be sure
what she was at—unless it were one thing.</p>

<p>‘Dost thou send me,’ he asked her, ‘to be her bane? art
thou so still and steadfast a hater?’</p>

<p>‘I send you not at all,’ she answered. ‘It is she that
calls. Remember that against the time when you have
need to remember it.’</p>

<p>He caught her up and kissed her repeatedly. ‘Sit
thou still, Jeannie, and watch,’ says he; ‘keep my house
and stuff, and have a prayer on thy lips for me. Never
doubt me, my dear. Doubt all the world to come, but
doubt not me.’</p>

<p>She said, ‘I am very sure of you—both of what you
will do, and what you will not do.’</p>

<p>He kissed her again, and left her. She did not come
out to see him ride away.</p>

<p class="tb">Cantering on grass through the hot starry night, he
called Des-Essars to his side and questioned him closely
about the letter. How did she write it? What did she
say? Who was by?</p>

<p>‘My lord,’ said Baptist, ‘I myself was by. No other at
all. She bade me take it straight to your lordship, surely
and secretly. She wrote it herself and sealed it with the
ring on her forefinger. But she wrote nothing until she
had washed her hands.’</p>

<p>‘Why, my lad,’ says he, ‘were her hands so foul?’</p>

<p>‘My lord, they were the fairest, whitest hands in the
world. But she washed them many times, until, as she
said, they smelt of roses, and not of Scotland.’</p>

<p>‘The plot thickens, God strike me! What else, boy?’</p>

<p>‘Nothing more, my lord, save that she gave me the
letter, as I have told your lordship, and sent me directly
away.’</p>

<h3 id="II_CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="smaller">EXTRACTS FROM THE DIURNALL OF THE MASTER OF SEMPILL</span></h3>

<p>That sandy-haired, fresh-coloured, tall gentleman, John
Sempill, Master of Sempill, received his Mary Livingstone
on her return from the Court with more demonstration
than was held seemly in Scotland; but they were his own
servants who saw him, and he was sincerely glad to have
her back. Not only the pattern housewife, but the ornament
of his hearth, the most buxom of the Maries, the
highest-headed, greatest-hearted, the ruddiest and the
ripest—well might he say, as he fondled her, ‘My lammie,
thou art a salve for my sair een,’ and even more to the
same effect.</p>

<p>‘By your favour, Master,’ quoth she, ‘you shall give
over your pawing. I am travel-weary and heart-weary,
and you trouble me.’</p>

<p>‘Heart-weary, dear love!’ cried the Master. ‘And you
so new back to your bairn and your man!’</p>

<p>‘I am full fain of you, Master, and fine you know it.
And our bairn is the pride of my eyes. But I grieve over
what I’ve left behind me; my heart is woe for her. And
indeed, if you must have it, I am near famishing for want
of bite and sup.’</p>

<p>‘Come away, woman, come away,’ said the Master,
justly shocked. ‘There’s the best pasty on the board that
ever you set your bonny teeth to, and a brew of malt unmatched
in Renfrew. Or would you have the Canary?
Or happen the French wine is to your liking? Give a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
name to it, wife, for it’s a’ your ain, ye ken.’ He hovered
about her, anxious to serve, while she pulled at her gauntlets.</p>

<p>‘The fiend is in the gloves, I think. There then, they’re
off. Master, I’ll take a cup of the red French wine.
Maybe it will put heart into me.’</p>

<p>‘Take your victual, take your victual, my lady,’ says
the Master, ‘I’ll be back just now.’ He was his own
cellarer, prudent man, and was apt to excuse himself by
saying that one lock was better than two.</p>

<p>The wine brought back the colour to her cheeks and
loosened the joints of her tongue. All he had now to do
was to listen to her troubles: and he did listen. It is
likely that, had she been less charged with them, she had
been warier; but she was indeed surcharged. He soon
understood that it was the coming of the Earl of Bothwell
that had caused her return.</p>

<p>‘Not that I would not have braved him out, you must
know, Master—bristling boar though he be, dangerous,
boastful, glorious man. It would take a dozen of Hepburns
to scare me from my duty. But oh,’tis herself that scares
me now! So changed, so sore changed. You might lay
it to witchcraft and be no fool.’</p>

<p>‘’Twill be the lying-in, I doubt,’ says the sage Master.
‘You mind how hardly my sister Menzies took her first.
Ay, ’twill be that.’</p>

<p>Mary Livingstone would not have it. ‘There are many
that say so, but I am not one. No, no. I know very well
where to look for it. Witchcraft it is, night-spells. I
mind the beginning o’t. Why, when I first saw her, all
dim as I was with my tears, her heart went out to me—held
out to me in her stretched hands. She took me to
her sweet warm bosom, and I could have swooned for joy
of her, to be there again. “Oh, Livingstone, my dear, my
dear! Come back to me at last!” And so we weep and
cling together, and all’s as it had ever been. For you
know very well we were never long divided.’</p>

<p>‘Never long enough for me, Mary, in my courting
time.’</p>

<p>‘She was expecting her wean from day to day, and I
tell you she longed for the hour. She was aye sewing his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
little clothes—embroidering them—ciphers and crowns
and the like. She worked him his guiding-strings with
her own hands, every stitch—gold knot-work, you never
saw better. And all her talk was of him.’</p>

<p>‘Likely, likely,’ murmured the Master.</p>

<p>‘She never wavered but it was to be a prince, for all
that we teased her—spoke of the Princess Mary that was
coming—or should it not be Princess Margaret? She
smiled in her steady way, as she uses when she feels wise,
knowing what others cannot know. “No other Mary in
Scotland,” she said. “There are five of us now, and Scotland
can hold no more. My Prince Jamie must wed with
a Margaret if he needs one.” No, she never doubted, and
you see she was right. Oh, she was right and well before
the magic got to work!</p>

<p>‘To me she used to talk, more nearly than to the others.
Poor Fleming! You’ll have heard of her sore disgrace—for
favouring that lank Lethington of hers. She is suspect,
you must know, of seeking his recall, so hath no privacy
with our mistress. Beaton and Seton were never of such
account; so ’twas to me she spoke her secrets—over and
over in the long still forenoons, wondering and doubting
and hoping, poor lamb. “Do you think he’ll lippen to
me, Livingstone?” she would say. “Did your own child
laugh to see his mother? I think ’twould break my heart,”
she said, “if he greeted in my arms.” She intended to be
nurse to him herself: that I will hold by before the
Thronéd Three on Doomsday. Not a night went by but,
when I came to her in the morn, she bade me look, and
try, and be sure. I told her true, she could do it. And
what hindered her, pray? What drove away her milk?
Eh, sir, I doubt I know too well.</p>

<p>‘It was Beaton brought in that old quean, that liggar-lady
of Bothwell’s, that lickorish, ramping Reres. Mother’s
sister of Beaton’s she is, own sister to the wise wife of
Buccleuch, with witchcraft in the marrow of her. What
made Beaton do it? Let God tell you if He care. I
think the Lord God may well have covered His face to
hear her tales. Such a tainted history I never listened to—<i>pourriture
de France!</i> Oh, Master, I’ve heard the Count<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
of Anjou and his minions, and Madame Marguerite and all
hers at their wicked talk. I’ve heard Bothwell blaspheme
high Heaven in three tongues, and had the bloat Italian
scald my ears with a single word. But the Reres beats all.
Good guide us, where hath she not made herself snug?
Whose purchase hath she not been? Man, I cannot tell
you the tales she told, nor one-quarter the shamefulness
she dared to report. And the soft lingering tongue of the
woman! And how she lets her scabrous words drop from
her like butter from a hot spoon! My poor lamb was
weary of bed and body, I’ll allow. I’ll own the old limmer
made her laugh; she never could refuse a jest, as you
know, however salted it might be. No: she must listen
and must laugh, while I could have stabbed the old speckled
wife. But my Queen Mary kept her at the bedside; and
there they were, she and this Reres, for ever kuttering and
whispering together. ’Twas then, in my belief, the cast
was made, and the wax moulded and the spells set working.</p>

<p>‘For mark you this. The pains came on o’ the Wednesday
morn, in the small grey hours; and by nine o’clock
the child was born alive. It wailed from the first—never
was such a fretful bairn; and she could hear him, and
grieved over it, and could not find rest when most she
needed it. And then—when they put it to her—she could
not nurse it. Oh, Master, I could have maimed my own
breast to help her! She tried—sore, sore she tried; she
schooled herself to smile, though the sweat fairly bathed
her; she crooned to it, sang her French, her pretty stammering
Scots; but all to no purpose—no purpose at all.
The child just labbered itself and her—my bonny lamb—and
got no meat.</p>

<p>‘Master, it fairly broke her spirit. She did not fret, she
did not lament, but lay just, and stared at the wall; and
not a maid nor woman among us could rouse her. The
old Reres tried her sculduddery and night-house talk, but
did no better than we with our coaxing and prayers. She
had no heart, no care, no pride in the world; but just let
all go, and thrung herself face to the wall.</p>

<p>‘The lords came about her, and she showed them their
prince: you could see she scorned them on their knees, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
herself to whom they knelt. The craven King came in
behind them, and she bade him kiss his own son. She
looked him over, with all the dry rage withering her face—you’ld
have said she had chalked herself!—and spoke him
terrible words. “I may forgive, but I shall never forget,”
she said: and to an Englishman who was with him—“He
has broken my heart.” A King! He’s a spoiled toy in
her hands; and the like is all the glory of Scotland—a
thing of no worth to her. What hath changed her so but
witchcraft? Ah, what else hath such a wicked virtue?
Soon after this she sent for Bothwell; and when he came
she was up and about—mad, mad, mad for her pastime;
drinking of pleasure, you may say, like a thirsty dog, that
fairly bites the water. Oh, Master, I am sick at the heart
with all I’ve seen and heard!’</p>

<p>‘Let me comfort my Heart and Joy!’ said the really
loving Master, and applied himself to the marital privilege.
Extracts from his <i>Diurnall</i>, with which I have been
favoured by a learned Pen, shall follow here—not without
their illustrative value in this narrative. I omit all reference
to the redding of the hay, the wool sales of each week,
statistical comparisons of the lands of Beltrees with other
sheep-ground, Sandy Graeme’s hen, the draining of Kelpie’s
Moss, a famous hunting of rats on Lammas Day, and other
matters of a domestic or fleeting interest.</p>

<p>It is not without pain, be it added, that I allow the
Master to display himself naked, as it were, and far from
ashamed. It will be seen—I regret to say it—that he was
not above trafficking his good wife’s heart, or sending her
to grass—in pastoral figure!—when the milk ran dry.
Commerce and the Affections! Well, he was not alone in
Scotland; there were belted Earls in the trade with him—canny
chafferers in the market-place, or (in Knox’s phrase)
Flies at the Honeypot. He was no better than his neighbours;
and you will hear the conclusion of their whole
matter, from a shrewd observer, at the end of this book.</p>

<p>The first date in the <i>Diurnall</i> of any moment to us is—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>July the 22.</i>—Yester-een my dear wife Mary Livingstone, blessed
be God, returned to her home. Being comforted and stayed, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
had much to rehearse of Court doings. Great tales: Forbes of
Reres’ lady, a very gamester; the Earl of Both., and others.
Harsh entreaty of the K—— before many witnesses. <i>Mem. Not
to forget own advantage in such news</i>, nor the Earl of Bedf(ord)
and Mr. C(ecil).<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p class="tb"><i>July the 24.</i>—I wrote out my proffer fair for the Earl of Bed(ford).
John Leng rode with it, a sad [discreet] person. Wool
sales this week ... Sandy Graeme: havers anent his hen....
M(ary) L(ivingstone) easier in mind, haler in body. Spake freely
of the Court. The Q—— sent a French youth for the Earl of
Both., and when he came saw him alone in her chamber. This
would be great news for Engl(and), but and if they would pay my
price. <i>Mem. To be stiff, not to abate. Æquam memento rebus in
arduis servare mentem.</i></p>

<p class="tb"><i>July the 27.</i>— ... M. L(ivingstone) saith that her mate
Fl(eming) would give <i>all lawful things</i> to have back the
Sec(retary), <i>even to her allegiance as a subject</i>; so intemperate is
the passion of love in women. Saith that the Earl of Both.
desires the K—— to recall Mr. A(rchibald) D(ouglas) in order
that he may betray my Lo. of M(oray) to the Q——. Maybe
the K—— would do it, if he had enough credit with her. The
K—— hates my lord of Both. as mortally as ever he did the late
Italian, <i>but not with any more reason</i>; at least M. L(ivingstone)
will not admit any. Pressed her, but as yet fruitlessly. She is
clear that there will be open strife between the Earls of Both. and
Mo(ray): but the darker man hath a sure hold on himself and
his friends. <i>Mem. To write all this fairly to-morrow in the new
Spanish cipher. Mem. 2. She saith that the Earl of H(untly) is
now Chanc(ellor) and a declared lover of the Q——. Harmless,
because the Q—— hath little to give but scorn to them that openly
love her.</i></p>

<p class="tb"><i>August the 3.</i>—Letter from my lord of Bed(ford). His gross
English manners. He asks roundly what price is demanded.
This is shameful dealing—greatly offended. John Leng saw my
lord personally in Berw(ick), and was asked to devise secret means
to speak with me. Most certain that he hath writ to the Q——
of Eng(land). I shall tell him <i>nothing</i> as yet, and <i>write but round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
about</i>.... News this day that the Q—— hath gone to Alloa;
<i>but mark in what manner</i>. The K—— was invited; and offered
himself to ride with her. <i>Refused.</i> Whereupon he set out alone,
only his English with him; and the Q—— embarked with the
lord of Both. in a little ship from Newhaven. Our informant
saith not who accompanied them, save that they were famous
<i>robbers and pirates</i>. Suspect Ormiston and Hay of Tala, known
to me for desperate men. M(ary) S(eton) went along with her.
Lady Re(res) took the Pr(ince). <i>Mem. M. L(ivingstone) should
go to Alloa, but it likes her not to leave her child. Her shape too....
Mem. 2. To write, very shortly and finally, into Eng(land).</i></p>

<p class="tb"><i>August the 7.</i>—News this day from M. Fl(eming). Sir James
Mel(vill) gave the K—— a cocker spaniel of his own rearing, and
the K—— boasting of this (for they are rare who show him any
kindness in these days), it came to the Q——’s ears. Fl(eming)
writeth that she rated Sir James sharply for this in the gallery at
Alloa, saying, ‘I cannot trust one that loves them that I love not.’
Sir James all pothered to reply; rare for him. She flung away
before the words were ready, and took my lord of Both(well’s)
arm....</p>

<p>The Earl of Mor(ton) writeth me from Northumberland with a
fat buck from Chillingham. Hopeth I will stand his friend for
the sake of my father, whom (saith he) he entirely loves. His
heart is woe for Scotland, and any news which may help him
thither he will be thankful of. <i>Mem. To write him civilly my
thanks, and tell him something, but not near all. Enough to let
him see that I know more....</i></p>

<p>Sandy Graeme very resolute upon the hen; spake insolently to
me this day. He threatens to pursue....</p>

<p class="tb"><i>August the 15.</i>—The K——, we hear, flew into a great passion
of late, and threatened to have the life out of my Lord of Mor(ay)—but
not in my lord’s hearing. He is vexed to death that the
Q—— consorts with those two earls, his chief enemies (as he
thinks): I mean Both. and Mor(ay). The Q—— reported his
threat to her brother; and now the K—— is gone away, supposed
to Dunfermline; but he kept it very secret. The Q—— is to
hunt the deer in Meggatdale, we learn. I have at last prevailed
upon M. L(ivingstone) to seek the Court. She goes, but not
willingly. In my letter of this day to Eng(land) I plainly said
that the intelligence I had was worthy the Q—— of Eng(land’s)
study. ‘Let her write soon,’I said, ‘or——’ and so left it. <i>Quos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
ego ...!</i> a powerful construction, <i>aposiopesis</i> hight. <i>Mem. To
see that John Leng renders just accounts of his spending on my
business.</i></p>

<p class="tb"><i>August the 17.</i>—My dear wife set out this day for the Court
at Stirling. Grievous charges of travel cheerfully borne by me.
She hath promised to write fully. Recommended her to have
circumspect dealing with my lord of Bothw., to be complaisant
<i>without laxity of principle</i>. ’Tis plain courtesy to salute the
Rising Sun, though savouring of idolatry <i>if carried to wicked
lengths</i>. She high-headed as ever....</p>

<p>A letter from the Earl of Mor(ton), which she desired to read
with me before she departed, wondering that he should honour
me. Lucky that the bay horse would not stand.... He writeth
plainly that he desires my service to win him home from his exile:
asketh me guiding lights, <i>how the land lies</i>, etc. Promises much,
but more to be regarded is his power to do harm. Of all lords
in this realm he hath the longest and deepest memory. But whom
can he hate of mine? Whom of any other body’s but of <i>One</i>,
and that one hated sorest of all men? Very rich also is he, and
covetous to have more. <i>Mem. To sleep upon the letter I shall
write him before returning his messenger.</i> He saith that A.
D(ouglas) is full of business of all sorts. I fear, a shameful
dealer.</p>

<p class="tb"><i>August the 23.</i>—Letter from my wife, the first she hath writ;
full of juicy meat. The Q—— took the K—— into favour
again and suffered his company in Meggatdale. She fears what
he may do against her if he is alone, or with his father. The
lords of Bothw., Mor(ay), and Ma(r) present there; and M. S(eton)
and a few more. Cramalt would not hold near so many. Some
lay at Henderland, some with Scott of Tushielaw. Scott of Harden
offered and was refused—supposed for fear of the Douglas
house by-north of him. Afterwards they went to Traq(uair). The
K——, being disguised in drink, held monstrous open talk of the
Q—— there, calling her a brood mare of his, and other such
filthy boasting. Sharply rebuked by my lord Both., he had no
reply to make. Thus it is with him, I see. The least favour
shown, it flieth to his head. At heart he is a very craven. <i>He is
a rogue in grain....</i></p>

<p>News that Ker of Cessford hath slain the Abbot of Kelso.
Met on the bridge, each with a company, and had words; from
words fell to blows. <i>Tu ne cede malis, sed contra audentior ito.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
True: but how if life be threatened? Is it not wiser <i>to bend to the
gale</i>? And where doth this Evil One lie, and how to be discerned
by simple man? Alas! the times are lawless! <i>Mem. John Leng
not home from Ber(wick). He may have with him that which
would make him worth the robbery. To enquire for him at
the post.</i></p>

<p>... Sandy Graeme: his hen a rankling thorn, whereof, it
seems, I must die daily....</p>

<p class="tb"><i>August the 28.</i>—I learn that M. Fl(eming) hath won her suit.
The Earl of Ath(oll) wrought for her, and my lord of Mor(ay)
did not gainsay. Therefore Mr. S(ecretary) cometh back. The
Q——, it is said, pleaded with my lord of Bothw. to do the man
no harm—<i>very meekly, as a wife with her husband</i>. So it was
done, and he received at Sir W. Betts’ house in Stirling, after
dinner. Present, the Q——, Lady Ma(r), Earls of Ath(oll),
Mor(ay), and Bothw. Leth(ington) went down on his two knees,
they say, wept, kissed hands. Then, when he was on his feet
again, the Q—— took him by the one hand and gave her other
to the lords in turn. My lord of Bothw. could not refuse her.
Leth(ington) as proud as a cock, saith my dear wife, who saw him
afterwards at the <i>coucher</i> by Fl(eming’s) side. I suppose she will
have him now. He is restored to all his offices and is sent away
to Edinburgh, whither the Q—— must go soon to oversee her
revenues. She will lodge in the Chequer House, I hear. <i>Now,
why doth she so?</i> They establish the Pr(ince) at Stirling: Lady
Re(res) to be Mistress of his household, an evil choice. My wife
hateth her so sore she will not write her name, lest, as she saith,
the pen should stink. Scandalous doings at Stirling abound.
The Q—— in a short kirtle, loose hair, dancing about the Cross
with young men and maids: not possible to be restrained in
anything she is conceited of. <i>Mem. To consider closely about
the Chequer House.</i> I mind that one Master Chalmers, a
philosophic doubter of mysteries, is neighbour unto it. A friend
of my lord of Bothw. in old times. They say, his pædagogue.
<i>Sed quære....</i></p>

<p>John Leng returned Monday last. I fear little to be done with
Engl(and). Mr. C(ecil), most indurate, crafty man, must needs
‘see the goods before he can appraise them.’ A likely profit!
<i>Mem. To consider of the Earl of Mor(ton), if he knoweth of
Leth(ington) in new favour?</i> A good stroke for him, well worth
some outlay. <i>But the charge of a messenger for such a thing?...</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p class="tb"><i>September the 24.</i>—Strong matter from my wife—the strongest—writ
from Edinburgh. There came in a letter from the K——’s
father, my lord of Len(nox), long a stranger to the Court (and
with good reason of his own), which put the Q—— in a flutter.
She was taken ill and kept her bed. My wife saw her. This
lord, it seems, wrote to her Majesty that he could no longer
answer for the mind of the K—— his son; that <i>it was not in his
power</i> to stay the K—— <i>from a voyage abroad</i>. Much more; but
this the first. The Q—— wept and tossed herself about. <i>Note
this well</i>: the Earl of Bothw. was at Hermitage in Liddesdale.</p>

</div>

<p>But of this, and its wild results, I prefer my own relation.
No more as yet of the Master.</p>

<h3 id="II_CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="smaller">ARMIDA DOUBTFUL IN THE GARDEN</span></h3>

<p>To the Chequer House at Edinburgh belonged a pleasant
garden of yew alleys, grass walks, nut-trees, and bowers
cut out of box. You could pace the round of it by the
limiting wall, keeping on turf all the way, and see the
sky-line broken by the red gables and spires of the little
clean city, being nevertheless within boskage so generous
that no man’s window could spy upon you. Thus it was
that orderly Mr. David Chalmers, in his decent furred robe
and skull-cap, was able to tread his own plot, his hands
coupled behind his back, and to meditate upon Philosophy,
Gnomic Poetry, and Moral Emblems, undisturbed by the
wafts of song, rustling of maids’ farthingales, flying feet of
pages, or sound of kisses refused or snatched, which those
neighbour green recesses witnessed and kept to themselves.
In the Chequer Garden, this mellow end of September,
the Court took solace while the state revenues were under
review, the Queen’s custom being to work in the garden-room,
a long covered loggia edging the slopes of grass,
from nine to eleven in the forenoon, then to walk for an
hour, and then to dine. Holyrood was wide, Holyrood
was near, Holyrood stood empty: this was a whim of hers—no
more.</p>

<p>Great days were these for Mr. Secretary Lethington: to
feel the sun of royal favour genially warm upon his back
once more; to seek (and surely find) assurance of good
fortune in the brown eyes of the sweetest, most modest,
gentlest-hearted lady in Scotland. Did he not owe everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
to Mary Fleming? And was she not a sweet
creditor? And next to her he stood indebted to the
weather. The man was sensitive to climate, and, like all
sensitive men, loved autumn best. ‘This slope sun, which
will neither scorch nor refuse his clemency, dearest lady,’
he said; ‘these milky skies, which never seem to lose the
freshness of dawn; the very gentle death—most merciful!—which
each Day suffers; the balm of Night’s dipped
fingers shed upon our brows: are not these things an
augury (O my true love!) of even life for you and me?
Even life, a peaceful ending of our days, with the angry
solstice turned, the dry heat, the bared wrath of the sun
far from us! Indeed, indeed, I do believe it.’ Mary
Fleming, looking steadfastly into the pale sky, would be
too sure of herself to feel abashed by his fervour. ‘And
I, sir,’ she would answer, ‘pray for it daily.’</p>

<p>Mr. Secretary, at such times as these, felt purified,
ennobled, a clean man. Working with the Queen through
mornings of golden mist and veiled heat, he did his very
best in her service, and laboured to respond to all her
moods with that alacrity, clear sight, and good-humour
which he saw very well his present state required. He
was one of those men who, like beasts of chase, take
colour from their surroundings. If you stroke your
dormouse his coat will answer; he will burnish to a foxy
brightness under the hand. And so with Mr. Secretary.
His lady-love was kind, his sovereign trusted him again:
he shone under such favour, dared to be in charity with all
men, and was most worthy of trust. He thought little of
bygone stresses, of the late months when he had lurked,
gnawing his cheek, in the hills of the west; it was impossible
for the like of him to believe that he had ever
been otherwise than now he was. He fancied himself a
book opened at a clean page, and never turned back to
regard earlier chapters, blotted and ugly. Forward, rather,
looked he—upon many fair folios of untouched vellum.
‘Upon these we will print in golden types, my heart, the
<i>gestes</i> of the twin-flight to the stars of William Maitland of
Lethington and Mary Fleming, his spouse: <i>deux cors, ung
coer!</i>’ And she, loving soul, believed the man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p>The Queen, since that summer’s day when, with ritual,
she had washed her hands in rose-water, had known many
moods. Some were of dangerous sweetness, as of treading
a brink hand in hand; some of full joy in air and weather,
as when Lord Bothwell and his men steered her across the
dancing sea, and the little ship, plunging in blue waters,
tossed up the spray to kiss her cheeks, or sting unmannerly
her happy eyes. There had been days also of high revelry
at Stirling—dancings, hawkings, romping games, disguises;
days of bravado, where Memory was dared to do her
worst. All of these, as Mary Livingstone told her husband,
with Lord Bothwell at her side and the King out
of mind. Some days she had had of doubtful questioning,
of heart-probing, drawing-back; a sense (to be nursed) of
nothing yet lost, of all being yet well; and others—but
then she had been quite alone—when, upon her knees,
with bent-down head and hands crossed over the breast,
she had whispered to herself the words of fate: ‘Behold
one stronger than I, who, coming, shall overshadow me.
Take me, lord, take me, take me, such as I am.’ After
such times as these she would walk among her women
with a rapt, pure face, her soul sitting in her eyes, or
half-risen, quivering there, trembling in strength, sensing
the air, beating, ready to fly. Then, as they looked at her
wondering, she would sit with them and talk gently, in a
low kind voice, about their affairs; and Mary Livingstone,
who knew her at her best when she was quick and masterful,
feared most for her then; and Mary Fleming, who had
but one thought in her heart, took courage—and at some
such time pleaded for, and won back, her banished
lover.</p>

<p>So it was with her during all that summer and early
autumn, while the Master of Sempill (healthy-faced man)
was filling his <i>Diurnall</i>, and doing his best to fill his pocket,
by emptying his wife of confidences and betraying her
afterwards. But when she came back from Stirling,
enriched in divers ways, she had to find that the graceless
King had not lost his power of the spur. By degrees and
degrees dark rumours gathered about her, of which he was
the nucleus. She heard of his quarrelling at Dunfermline,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
of a night-fray at Cameron Brig in which he was suspected
of a share; of his man Standen with a wounded head, and
the King swearing he would burn the doer of it out of
house and jacket. Now, who had wounded Standen’s
head? Nobody could tell her.</p>

<p>Then there were threats sent about town and country
by craped messengers: ‘The Earl of Moray should beware
how he rides abroad’; or ‘Let the Lord of Bothwell look
to the inmates of his house’—and so forth. Worse than
these were the hints thrown out to Du Croc, the French
Ambassador—hints which pointed at the safety of the
prince her son, and at the King as the author of them.
Flying words had been caught in galleries and corridors;
somebody saw the white face of Forrest, his chamber-child,
frozen by terror into silence. They had him in among
them, and twisted his arm: he would not deny, he would
not affirm, but wept copiously and moaned for his mother
in Winchester. Mysteries and mischiefs were all about
her; and everything she could gather insisted on one fact—that
the King intended action of his own oversea or in
England—she could not tell which.</p>

<p>Loathing the task as much as the taskmaster, she looked
her affairs in the face. For one thing, they gave her back
a distorted image of her own face. She had washed her
hands, she had been happy, thought herself free,—why,
why, what a purblind fool! She had been playing the
May Day queen, like any chimney-sweeper’s wench, in a
torn petticoat. A rent panoply to cover her, a mantle-royal
full of old clouts! The discovery threw her into
despair: ‘Here am I, Mary of France and Scotland, a
crowned woman—bankrupt, at the mercy of a sot to whom
I lent my honour twice!’ Under the bite and rankle of
this thought, grown fearfully eager, she looked about all
ways for escape. Divorce! No, no, that would bastardise
her son. The strong hand, then! Let her lay hands upon
the traitor to her throne and bed. There was ample proof
against him; the Riccio plot had been enough by itself—but
what stayed her was the question, whose hands should
she set at him? Why, who was there in all Scotland at
this hour who would show him any mercy, once he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
him? She could not answer that; there was nobody. No.
She stood—she was sure of it—between the King and his
murder. ‘But for me,’ she said bitterly, ‘but for me, whom
he has dipped in shame, he is a dead man.’ For a long
time she stood pondering this, a bleak smile on her lips,
and one finger touching her breast.</p>

<p>So might she remain standing; but she could not have
him slain. Not though he had sought to betray her,
spurned her worth, made her a mock; not though he would
steal her child, tamper with her enemies, sell her for a
price. All this was true, and more. She grew scarlet to
admit to herself that more was true. She was his wedded
wife, at his beck and call: and now she loved a Man; and
love (as always) made her pure virgin. The shame of the
truth flooded her with colour.—But no! She stood between
the King and his murderers. If he persisted in his misdeeds,
she had but to stand aside and they would kill him.
Well, <i>she could not stand aside</i>; therefore she must coax
him back to decency—by the arts of women.</p>

<p>Hateful necessity! And yet if you had seen her at her
window as she faced it, looking askance at the green sky,
you would have thought her just a love-sick girl spying for
her lover: for that was her wont, to smile, and peer, and
turn her pretty head; pick with her fingers at the pleats of
her gown, and be most winning when at the verge of loss.
And even when she had decided upon bargaining with the
man she abhorred, she did not abhor the act. It would be
a delicate exercise of the wits—most delicate. For observe
this well, you who desire to know her: although she stood
between the man and his murder, <i>while she stood there</i>
she was absolutely at his mercy. He could do what he
chose with her. Bargaining! He could drive the most
terrible bargain. If she decided that he must not be killed,
she must needs deal tenderly with him, and fib and cheat
to save him. For she knew very well that whatever compunction
she had, he would have none. In a word, she
must prepare to save him alive, and pay him dearly for the
hateful privilege.</p>

<p>Very well. These conclusions worked out, she deliberately
sent word that she would see him, and he came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
her (as she had foreseen) in his worst mood—the hectoring
mood which knew her extremity and built upon it.</p>

<p class="tb">He had grown blotched, fatter in the face. His lower
lip hung down; there were creases underneath his angry
eyes. Excess of all sorts, but mostly of liquor, was responsible
for the thickening of what had never been fine,
and made him his own parody. He still held up his head,
still straddled his legs and stuck out his elbows; he still
had the arrogant way with him, and still appeared a fool
when he was most in danger of becoming a man. He
knew that his mere neighbourhood made her sick, and
what reason she had—cheapened by him as she had been,
held for a thing of nought, driven to feel herself vile.
Knowing all this, and resenting in her her knowledge of
his degradation, he was blusterously sulky; but knowing
further that she had sent for him because she was afraid of
what he might do against her, he was ready to bully her.
If there is one baser than he who takes heart to do wrong
from his wife’s tenderness, it is, I suppose, the man who
grows rich upon her dishonour. There is mighty little
to choose.</p>

<p>After a constrained greeting and uncomfortable pause,
she began the struggle. Directly she touched upon the
rumours, whose flying ends she had caught, he flamed out,
wagging his finger at her as if she had been taken red-handed
in some misdeed. Ah, if she considered that
he could be taken up and cast aside, lifted, carried about
like a girl’s plaything, it was a thing his honour could not
brook. Let her reflect upon that. He knew very well
what his own position was—how near he stood to the two
thrones, how his child’s birth made his title stronger. He
had had to think for himself what he should do—with his
friends, since those who should naturally be about him
chose to keep away, or could not dare be near him. He
had plans, thoughts, projects; had not made up his mind:
but let her take notice that he was about it. It was not to
be thought that a prince of any spirit could suffer as he
suffered now.</p>

<p>‘Ah, sir,’ she said here, putting up a hand, ‘and think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
you not whether I have suffered, or whether I suffer
now?’</p>

<p>He glared at her.</p>

<p>‘You have friends, madam, a sufficiency—ah, a redundancy,
in whose commerce I cannot see you engage
without suffering. You keep them from me—perhaps
wisely. There is my lord of Moray: with him I might
have a reckoning. But no! You hide him in your gown.’</p>

<p>‘How availed my gown to David?’ She was stung
into this.</p>

<p>He squared his shoulders. ‘The man paid dearly for
what he had. He should have counted the cost. So
should others count. Let my lord of Bothwell figure out
his bill.’</p>

<p>‘No more of that, my lord,’ she cried in a rage. ‘You
little know what my gown hides, if not that it shelters yourself.
Do you know, sir, from what I am screening you?’</p>

<p>‘You screen me, madam! You! But I cannot suffer
it. It is to abase me. I cannot suffer it. But it’s all of a
piece—I am shortened every way. My friends are warned
off me—my father a suspect—my means of living straitened—I
have no money, no credit. I, the King-Consort, the
father of the Prince! Oh, fie, madam, this is a scandal
and crying shame. Where are my rights—where is one
of them? Where is my right to be by your side? Where
are my rights of a husband?’</p>

<p>‘They are where you put them—and as you have made
them.’</p>

<p>He began to storm; but as she met every blast with the
same words, he took another course. ‘A truce,’ he said,
‘madam, to your taunts. These may be my last words to
you, or the first of many happier speeches. The past is
past and over. I have admitted the excesses of my youth
and temper; you have condoned them, or so professed.
Now, madam, I say this: You have sent for me—here I
am. If you suffer me, I stay, and use you as a loving
man his wife. But if you will not, I go; and maybe you
see me not again.’</p>

<p>She fairly cowered at the choice. She covered her ears.
‘Ah, no, no! Ah, but that is not possible!’ Why, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
she to break her written promise, make foul again her
washen hands? She sat astare, beaten down and dumb;
and the words of her vow came up, as it were, fiery out of
the floor, and smote her in the face like a hot breath.</p>

<p>But his courage rose at the glimpse of so much power in
his hands. Not possible, said she. Ah, but he said it was
essential. He looked at her, white and extended there; he
felt and exulted in his strength. And then it came surging
into his mind that she must be his price to stay, and that
either to get her again or to lose her he would drown
Scotland in blood.</p>

<p>There was a wild-beating pause, in the which she sat,
catching at the edge of the coffer, her face turned to the
window. He could see her strained throat, her short-rising
breast, and knew that he could prevail. For once in his
foolish life he took the straight road to what he craved; for
he shook his hair back, strode directly to her, took her up
and caught her round the arms. So she was all a prisoner.
‘Aha, my wood-bird, aha! Now, now I have you in a net.
Not again do you escape.’ He began to kiss her face;
there was no escape indeed. Abashed, overwhelmed, half-swooning,
she gave up; and so made her bargain. To
save him from murder she murdered her own honour. So
she would put it to herself. But let us, for our part,
record it in her honour.</p>

<p class="tb">If you will reason out his nature—which is that of the
fed mule—you will find his behaviour next day in the
Council of a piece with all the rest. Having been made
master by her nobility, he supposed himself master by the
grace of God given to man. When he marched into the
Council Chamber and took her proffered hand, his pride
swelled up into his eyes, and made him see thickly. Ho!
now for the manly part. Here, in the midst of his enemies—before
this black Moray, this dark-smiling Huntly, this
lean thief Lethington—here, too, he would play the man.</p>

<p>Knowing him pledged to her, the Queen was gentle.
‘I beseech you, my lord,’ she said, ‘if you have any grief
against me—as now I think you have not—or any cause
which moves you to quit this realm (which I cannot suppose),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
declare it before these lords. If I have denied you any
right, either of access to the prince our son, or any other
right, pray you rehearse it now.’</p>

<p>He would not speak out. He pursed his lips, frowned,
raised his eyebrows, tapped his heel on the floor. He said
that he must be advised. He did not see any of his friends
here, with whom he must consult. There were many
things to consider, many calls upon him—from here, from
there, from elsewhere. He could not speak hastily, he
said, or give pledges.</p>

<p>Blankly dismayed, she began: ‘But, my good lord, your
promise to me——’ really forgetting for that moment
what his promises were worth. There, however, she
stopped—the words seemed to choke her.</p>

<p>Lethington rose and addressed him, speaking in French,
and good French. This was a courtesy to the Queen, one
of those trifling, terrible things which cost all Scotland
dear. For the King blushed to the roots of his hair, and
there was no hiding blushes upon that blond face. He
tried to answer in English; but a look of comical dismay
in Lethington warned him that he had blundered the
sense. He broke off short—furious, hot all over, blind
with mortification, and mad.</p>

<p>‘You speak too much French for me, Mr. Secretary.
My Scots, I doubt, would not be to your liking, either of
phrase or deed.’ His lip shook—he was nearly sobbing.
‘Madam,’ he cried out, ‘madam, adieu. You will not see
my face for many days.’ He lifted that hot, passionate,
boy’s face. ‘Gentlemen, adieu.’</p>

<p>Turning on his heel he walked directly from the room
and pulled-to the door after him. The Queen turned faint
and had to be helped. They fetched in women to see to
her; and the Council broke up, with a common intelligence
passed silently from man to man.</p>

<p>Mary Livingstone, half the night through, heard her
miserable wail. ‘Thrice a traitor, who has taught treachery
to me! Thrice a traitor—and myself a lying woman!’
She heard her talking to herself—pattering the words like
a mad-woman. ‘I must do it—I must do it—no sleep
for me until I do it. All, all, all—nothing hid. Things shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
go as they must. But he will never believe in me again—and
oh! he will be right.’</p>

<p>The very next day she sent for the Earl of Bothwell,
who was at Hermitage; and, when it was time, awaited him
in that shady garden of the Chequer House—she alone in
the mirk of evening. Whenas she heard his quick tread
upon the grass she shivered a little and drew her hood
close about her face; so that all he could see—and that
darkly—was her tall figure, the thin white wrist and the
hand holding the hood about her chin. Prepared for any
flight of her mind, grown so much the less ceremonious as
he was the more familiar, he saluted her with exaggerated
courtliness; the plumes of his hat brushed the grass as he
swept them round him. She did not move or speak. He
looked for her eyes, but could not see them.</p>

<p>‘Madam, I am here. Always, in all places, at the
service of my Sovereign.’</p>

<p>‘Hush!’ she said: ‘not so loud. I have to speak with
you upon an urgent affair. I can hardly bring myself to
do it—and yet—I must.’</p>

<p>‘Madam, I fear that you suffer. Why should you
speak?’</p>

<p>‘Because I must. You called me your Sovereign.’</p>

<p>‘And so, madam, you are, and shall be.’</p>

<p>‘That is why I choose to speak.’ She took a long deep
breath. ‘The King has been here,’ she said; ‘has been
here and is gone.’</p>

<p>He replied nothing, but watched her swaying outline.
There would be more to come.</p>

<p>‘I had reason to fear what he might contrive against my
peace—against my crown, and my son. Many things I
feared. He came here because I sent for him. And
I saw him.’</p>

<p>No help came from the watcher. Still he could not see
her face, hard as he might look for it. She drove herself
to her work.</p>

<p>‘He required of me certain assurances, otherwise, he
said, he would leave the kingdom. I dared not allow him
to depart, for I knew that he would work against me in
England or oversea. Moreover, leaving me, his life would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
be in instant danger. He did not know that; therefore
what he proposed was dangerous to himself and to me.
Do you understand? I feared that he would steal my son
and take him to England.’</p>

<p>Bothwell said, ‘I understand your fears.’</p>

<p>‘Therefore,’ said she, ‘I urged him to remain. This he
promised to do’—it was fine to see how her voice grew
clear to the attack—‘if I would yield him that which I
had purposed never to give him again. Do you understand
me now?’ She almost wailed the question.</p>

<p>He hastened to help her. ‘Yes, yes, madam. I beg
you to say no more.’</p>

<p>But she threw back her hood, and showed him her tense
white face. ‘I shall say all. No man shall hinder me.
He had once betrayed me and held me up to the scorn of
all women, and I promised you it should never be again.
Yet it was—the realm, my son, were in danger—and—oh,
sir, he has betrayed me now beyond repair! He has had
all of me, and now is gone I know not where—proud of
his lies, laughing at my folly.’ A terrible shuddering beset
her—terrible to hear.</p>

<p>‘Oh, madam,’ said Lord Bothwell, ‘let him laugh while
he can. What else hath a fool but his laughter?’</p>

<p>She stretched out her hands wide, and he drew nearer.</p>

<p>‘And for me, Bothwell? What is left for me?’</p>

<p>‘Madam,’ he said earnestly, ‘all is left. All which that
blasphemer was not fit to give, since he was not fit to
receive. Worship is left you, service of true men.’</p>

<p>She grew very serious. He could see her eyes now;
all black.</p>

<p>‘Not from you, Bothwell. Never more from you, since
I have lied.’</p>

<p>He took a step forward. ‘More from me, madam (if
you care to have it), than perhaps is fitting from a subject;
and yet less than perhaps may be reasonable from a man.’</p>

<p>‘No, no,’—she shook her head,—‘I have lied. Not
from you now.’</p>

<p>He laughed aloud. ‘Madam, beseech you see what I
see. A noble lady, justly enraged, who yet can stoop to
comfort her subject—who can humble herself to prove her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
kindness. Is that not worshipful? Is not that serviceworthy?
Oh, most glorious humility! Oh, proudest
pride of all! That Queen Mary should make confession
to James Hepburn! Why, Heaven above us, madam, for
what do you take me: a block of stone—a wooden stub?
Madam, Mistress, Queen—I am beaten to your feet—I am
water——’ He heard her sob, saw that she had covered
her face with her hands: he ran towards her. God of
Gods, what was this? ‘Have I offended your Majesty?
Am I so unhappy?’</p>

<p>She shook her head. ‘No, no, no! I cannot talk—but
I am not wretched. I am happy, I think—comforted.’</p>

<p>He considered her. He considered intently, every
muscle at a stretch. He bit his moustache, pressing it
into his teeth with his fingers—moved forward—stopped,
like a hawk poised in mid-air: he nodded his head savagely,
came up to her, and with gentle firmness took her by the
wrists, drew her hands from her face. ‘Look now at me,’
he said.</p>

<p>She did not struggle to be free, but kept her face averted,
strongly bent downward.</p>

<p>‘Look you at me.’</p>

<p>She shook her head. He felt her tears fall hot on his
hands.</p>

<p>‘But now,’ he said, ‘you must do as I bid you.’</p>

<p>Slowly she lifted then her head and faced him, looking
up. He saw the glittering tears; an honest tenderness
gave honesty to his words. ‘My heart!’ he said, ‘my
heart!’ and kissed her where she stood.</p>

<p>Then he turned and left her alone; went by her into the
thicket and climbed the wall into the neighbouring garden.
For a long time she stayed, with her two hands clasped at
her neck, where his had put them—for a long time, wondering
and trembling and blushing in the dark.</p>

<h3 id="II_CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="smaller">SCOTCHMEN’S BUSINESS</span></h3>

<p>When the Earl of Bothwell took off his boots that same
night, he said, as he threw them to his man Paris, ‘In the
morning we go to business.’</p>

<p>‘Ha, in a good hour!’ says Paris, a boot in each hand.
‘And to what business will your lordship be pleased to go?’</p>

<p>‘Man’s business, you fool,’ says the Earl; ‘carving and
clearing business; road-making business.’</p>

<p>Paris swung a boot. ‘I consider that there is no
gentleman in this deplorable country so apt for that
business,’ he said. ‘Do you ask me why? I will tell
your lordship very willingly. It is because there is no
other gentleman in this country at all.’</p>

<p>‘Apt or not,’ says Lord Bothwell, scratching in his
beard, ‘it is myself who will do it.’ He stared at the floor,
laughed, caught the word on his lips and kept it suspended
while he considered. Then he added, ‘And I signed the
contract, and sealed it, but an hour ago.’ He threw himself
naked on his bed, and Paris covered him with his blankets.</p>

<p>‘Happy dreams to your lordship, of the contract!’</p>

<p>‘Go to the devil,’ says my lord: ‘I’m asleep.’ And by
the next moment he was snoring.</p>

<p>Paris sat upon the floor, with a guttering candle beside
him, and made notches on a tally-stick. He told them
over on his fingers and got them pat before he lay down.</p>

<p>In the morning he sat upon the edge of his master’s bed—a
familiarity which had long been allowed him—produced
his tally, and enlarged upon it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Master,’ he said, ‘for your purpose these persons are
the best, as I shall shortly rehearse to you. I have chosen
each and every for some quality which is pre-eminently
useful, in which I believe him to be singular. The first
is Monsieur Ker of Fawdonsyde, who, it is true, is at the
moment in disgrace for his part in the Italian’s affair.
That can be got over, I think; and if so, well so. He has
the strongest wrist in this kingdom, next to your lordship’s,
and will do for a spare string to our bow: for I take it
yourself will be our first—not likely to fail, I grant; but
one must always be prepared in these cases for a sudden
jerk aside. Monsieur de Fawdonsyde may be trusted to
stop that. They tell me also of him that he can see in
the dark, and I can well believe it—a yellow-eyed man!
Nothing could be more useful to us; for somebody is sure
to blow the lights out, and in the ensuing scramble the
wrong man might be hurt, and some happy household
plunged into grief. Next, I certainly think that you
should have home Monsieur Archibald. He—if he do
no more—will be a comfortable stalking-horse. He is
kinsman—he was greatly beloved by <i>our man</i> in the old
days; and could make himself loved again, for he has a
supple mind. (Not so, however, his cousin, Monsieur de
Morton. He is too stiff a hater for our purpose, and could
not conceal it even if he would.) Now, I will tell you one
other reason in favour of Monsieur Archibald. I never
knew a gentleman of birth who could feel for chain mail in
a more natural and loving manner, except perhaps Milord
Ruthven, unhappily deceased. His son does not take after
him. But I saw Monsieur Archibald take the late David,
when there was a thought of going to work upon him,
round by the middle, and try his back in every part—just
as though he loved the very feel of him. And yet the two
were enemies! And yet David suspected nothing! It
could not have been better done: so I sincerely advise you
to have him. Monsieur d’Ormiston you will of course take
with you. He has ears like a hare’s, and so nice a valuation
of his own skin that you may be sure the roads will be
open for you when the affair is happily ended. But my
next choice will astonish you. Be prepared—listen, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
lord. It is Monsieur de Lennox! What! you cry—the
father to put away the son! With great respect, I hold to
my opinion. I believe Monsieur de Lennox could be persuaded—and
evidently you could have no more valuable
colleague—for two little reasons of cogency. He is miserable
in the ill-favour of our Queen, and he ardently desires
to stand well again with the English Queen. This, then,
would be his opportunity of gratifying both. And it is by
no means outside experience that a father should assist at
his son’s demise. There was a well-known case at Parma,
when we were in Italy; and if the Queen-Mother did not
contrive the exit of the late King Francis, then Maître
Ambroise Paré is a fool, and not a fine surgeon. Why did
she have the funeral oration prepared a week before that
King’s death? Ah, the thing is evident! Both of these
are Italians, you will say? I confess it. But if King
Philip of Spain hath not an eye of the same cast upon
Monseigneur Don Carlos I shall be surprised—and mark
this: Monsieur de Lennox is a hungry man, out of favour
and out of money. His lady, who has the purse, is in
the Tower of London; he himself dare not leave Glasgow,
where he starves. Moreover, he has another son.
Now——’</p>

<p>But here the Earl of Bothwell sat up in his bed.</p>

<p>‘What are you talking about, you fool?’ he asked,
gaping.</p>

<p>‘I am discussing the making of your lordship’s road,’
says Paris, ‘of which you did me the honour to speak
overnight.’</p>

<p>His master gave him a clout on the head, which knocked
him sideways to the floor. ‘You soiled cut-purse!’ he
roared at him, ‘you famous pirate, you jack-for-the-string,
what are you about? Do you think you are at sea, that
you can talk bloody designs to the open sky? Do you
think us all thieves on a galley, and the redding of a realm
as easy as to club the warder of a bench? Astounding
fool! with your blustering and botching, you’ll bring me
to a wooden bolster one of these days.’ He leaped from
his bed, and put his foot on the man’s neck. ‘If I don’t
make you swallow your infamous tally, call me a dunce!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span></p>

<p>Paris lay still, pale but serious. ‘It is difficult to discuss
matters of moment in this posture,’ he said; ‘but I can
assure your lordship that I have given a great deal of
thought to your business.’</p>

<p>‘And who under Heaven asked you for thought?’ cried
his master. ‘Or who in Heaven gave you the wit for it?
Get up, you monkey-man, and fetch me my clothes. We
don’t go to work that way in Scotland.’</p>

<p>‘I am conscious of it, master,’ said Paris, ‘and pity it is.
There is a saying in Italy, which dates from a very old
case of our kind, <i>Cosa fatta capo ha</i>: <i>a thing done</i>, say they,
<i>is done with</i>. Now here, a thing is so long a-contriving
that it is in danger of not being done at all. Love of
Heaven, sir! for what would you wait? What can your
lordship want beside the bounden gratitude of the Qu——.’
He stopped, because the Earl struck him on the mouth
with the back of his hand.</p>

<p>‘No names, you damned parrot!’</p>

<p>Paris, ashamed of himself, wiped his lips. ‘I admit the
indiscretion, my lord, and regret it. But my question was
pertinent.’</p>

<p>‘It was cursed nonsense,’ said the Earl, ‘and as impertinent
as yourself. Suppose I took this road of yours—what
would old Sourface be about? Where would his
prim eyes be? Looking through his fingers—seeing and
not seeing—for sure! Why, you toss-pot, we must have
him roped and gagged, or he’ll have us roped, I can tell
you—and as high as Haman. Bah! you make me
ashamed that ever I held words with such a gull. Peace
now, mind your business, and get me my drink. I am
going abroad—then to the Council.’</p>

<p class="tb">The first person of consequence he accosted that day
was the Lord of Lethington. The Secretary went in desperate
fear of him, as you could have told by the start he
gave when he felt the heavy hand clap his shoulder.</p>

<p>‘What scares you, man?’ The bluff voice was heard all
over the quadrangle, and many paused to see the play.
‘What scares you, man? You watch me like a hare—and
me your good friend and all!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I hope to serve your good lordship,’ says Mr. Secretary,
‘in the service that holds us both.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, yes, we had best work together. Now see here,
man—come apart.’ He took the unwilling arm, and bent
towards the timorous ear. Men on the watch saw the
Secretary’s interest grow as he listened: in the midst of
their pacing he stopped of his own accord, and pulled up
his companion.</p>

<p>‘Yes, my good lord, I could do that. There would be
no harm.’</p>

<p>‘Let my lord of Moray understand,’ continues Lord
Bothwell, ‘that signed words cannot say all that they import.
That is reasonable. But such as they are, such as
they bear, he himself must sign with the rest of us. I
shall not act without him, nor can the Queen be served.
Very well. Go to him presently, taking with you my lord
of Atholl. I seek first my lord of Argyll, next my brother
Huntly. We shall have the Earl of Crawfurd with us,
Mar I doubt not also; the Lords Seton, Livingstone,
Fleming, Herries——’</p>

<p>‘These for certain,’ says Lethington; then hesitated.</p>

<p>‘Well, man? Out wi’t.’</p>

<p>‘There is just this. Your lordship knows my lord of
Moray—a most politic nobleman.’</p>

<p>‘Politic! A pest!’</p>

<p>‘He is ever chary of putting hand to paper. I know of
one band, never signed by him. He wrote a letter, by
which all thought——But it purported nothing. However,
that is happily past.’</p>

<p>‘He signed away Davy,’ says Bothwell very calmly.</p>

<p>The Secretary turned quickly. ‘No, my lord, no! Upon
my oath he never did. Nothing would make him.’</p>

<p>Bothwell considered his twitching brows. ‘He signed
the letter which you now have, Lethington. By that you
hold him, cunning rogue though he be. Now, take me
this way. If he signs not to me before the Council, to the
effect that what I sign there he signs also, I move no
further.’</p>

<p>‘Your lordship will be wise. But——Oh, his fingers
are stiff at the pen!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Master Cecil in England can make them supple,’ says
Bothwell, ‘working at them through the palm. And so
can you, my friend, if I make you.’</p>

<p>Mr. Secretary closed his eyes.</p>

<p>‘You hold his letter,’ Bothwell went on, ‘wherein he
implicates himself in Davy’s killing. Now, if I go to him
with the news?’</p>

<p>‘Ha, my lord! But he knows very well that I
have it.’</p>

<p>‘Of course he knows. But the Queen does not know
it.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Now, if I tell him that you will use the letter against
him with the Queen, Mr. Secretary, you will be hanged.’</p>

<p>The Secretary flinched. ‘My lord,’ he said, ‘what is it
that you want from me?’</p>

<p>‘Your master’s sign-manual, hireling,’ says Bothwell.
‘Go and get it.’</p>

<p>He left him to scheme it out, of all wretches in Scotland
at that hour the one I could pity the most. Lethington
was a man who saw every head an empty pot compared
with his own; and yet, by mere pusillanimity, he had to
empty himself to fill them. He was a coward, must have
countenance if he were to have courage. With a brain
like his, a man might lord it over half Europe; yet the
water in his heart made him bond-slave of every old Scots
thief in turn. The only two he dared to best and betray
were——Well! we shall have to see him do it soon
enough. And yet, I say, pity Mr. Secretary!</p>

<p>The Earl of Atholl, kindly, dull man, who was his
friend through all, went with him now to beard the Bastard
of Scotland. Bolt upright in his elbow-chair, his Bible on
one hand, his sword and gloves on the other, my lord of
Moray listened to what was said without movement. His
face was a mask, his hands placid, his eyes fixed on the
standish. Atholl talked, Lethington talked, but not a
word was said of Bothwell so long as the first of these two
was in the room. The moment he was out of it, the
question came sharp and short.</p>

<p>‘Who stands in the dark of this, Lethington? Who is
at your back?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>

<p>Lethington never lied to his master. ‘My lord, it was
the Earl of Bothwell came suddenly upon me this
morning.’</p>

<p>‘You surprise me, sir. I had not thought you shared
confidences with that lord.’</p>

<p>‘Nor have I ever, my lord,’ says Lethington, with much
truth; ‘nor did I to-day. Such confidence as there was
came from him.’</p>

<p>‘Did he confide in you indeed? And what had he for
your ear?’</p>

<p>The Secretary narrowed his eyes. ‘Matters, my lord,
of such intimacy that I still marvel how they came to his
knowledge.’</p>

<p>‘I do not share your wonder. He is greatly trusted by
the Queen.’</p>

<p>‘True, my lord. But such things as he knoweth are
not, as I conjecture, fully known to her Majesty.’</p>

<p>Now it was that the Earl of Moray looked solemnly
at his servant. ‘You shall name these things to me,
Lethington, if you please.’</p>

<p>‘He knoweth, my lord, for certain, the names of all
who were privy to the bond for Davy’s slaughter.’</p>

<p>‘Why, yes, yes,’ says Lord Moray, ‘no doubt but he
does. For all of them were confessed to by the King,
who, indeed, showed her Majesty the bond.’</p>

<p>Mr. Secretary looked out of window. ‘I said, All who
were privy, my lord. I did not refer to the bond. He
knows more than is known to her Majesty; but considers
now what may be his duty in her regard.’</p>

<p>My Lord Moray blinked like an owl that fears the light.
He looked at his hands, sighed, cleared his brow of seams.
‘It would be well that I should confer with his lordship
upon that matter, before the Council sits,’ he said. ‘Pray
you, ask him to favour me at his leisure—at his perfect
leisure, Lethington. And when he is here—if he thinks
well to come—it would be convenient that yourself were
by, in case of need. The matter is a high one, and we
may be thankful of your experience. God speed you,
Lethington. God speed you well!’</p>

<p>Conference there then was between two acute intellects,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
which it would be profitable to report, if one could translate
it. But, where, in a conversation, every other word is left
out, the record must needs be tedious. The Queen was
not once mentioned, nor the King neither. The Earl of
Bothwell gave no hint that he knew his fellow-councillor
dipped deep in murder; the Earl of Moray did not let it
appear that he knew the other stripping for the same red
bath. Each understood each; each was necessary to the
other; each knew how far he could go with his ally, and
where their roads must fork; above all, both were statesmen
in conference, to whom decency of debate was a tradition.
Naming no names, fixing no prices, they haggled,
nevertheless, as acutely as old wives on the quayside; and
Mr. Secretary, nimble between them, reduced into writing
the incomprehensible. Thus it was that the Earl of Bothwell
promised under his hand to be the friend of the Earl
of Moray, ‘so far as lay within the Queen’s obedience’;
the Earl of Moray signified by the same tokens that he
would attend the Council and further the Queen’s service
in the matters to be moved by the Earl of Bothwell, ‘so
far as lay within the province of a Christian.’ Then Lord
Bothwell, apparently satisfied, went away to his friend and
brother-in-law, my Lord Huntly.</p>

<p class="tb">To the Council—it was the seventh of October—came
the lords: the Queen not present. It was a short and
curious convocation, as silent as that of Hamlet’s politic
worms, busy upon the affairs of Polonius. The Earl of
Huntly, as Chancellor, produced a parchment writing,
which was held up, but not read. ‘My lords,’ he said,
‘you shall see in the act of my hand at the pen a service
tendered to our sovereign lady, the which, seeing you are
acquainted with its nature, I do not discuss with your lordships.
Active service of the prince, my lords, may be of
two kinds: open movement against enemies avowed, and
secret defence against a masked, ambushed enemy.’ He
signed the writing, and passed to the Earl of Moray.
This one looked at it, read it through twice; took a pen,
inspected the point, dipped; detected a hair in the quill,
removed it, wiped his fingers, dipped again—and signed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
‘James.’ The parchment then went briskly about. Last
to sign it, far below the others, was the Lord of Lethington.</p>

<p>And what was in this famous bond? The Master of
Sempill, eager for news, got wind of it, and enshrined it in
his Diurnall. He has—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>October the 9.</i>—At a council two days since—the Q—— not
present, but the Earl of Both. returned from the country—I hear
from my wife, who had it from her father (there present), there
was a band passed round the board, read silently and signed by
each lord present. <i>Its terms</i>: That the Q—— only should be
obeyed as natural sovereign, and the authority of her dearest
consort, and of all others whomsoever, of no force without her
pleasure first known. The Lords Both., Hun(tley), Mor(ay),

<p>The Master was out in his dates. The very night after
the Council Lord Bothwell rode fast into Liddesdale; and
next day the Queen, with her brothers, Lord Huntly, and
the Court, went over the hills to Jedburgh. The King was
believed to be in the West with his father, but no one knew
for certain where he was.</p>

<p>It is rather better than five years since you first met with
Des-Essars in the sunny garden at Nancy, and as yet I
have but dipped into the curious little furtive book which,
for my own part, although its authenticity has been disputed,
I attribute to him without hesitation—<i>Le Secret des
Secrets</i>, as it is called. For such neglect as this may be I
have the first-rate excuse that it contains nothing to what
has been my purpose; all that there is of it, prior to the
October 1566 where now we are, seeming to have been
added by way of prologue to the Revealed Mysteries he
thought himself inspired to declare. Probably, no secrets
had, so far, come in his way, or none worth speaking of.
‘Boys’ secrets,’ as he says somewhere, ‘are truly but a
mode of communicating news, which when it is particularly
urgent to be spread, is called <i>a secret</i>. The term ensures
that it will be listened to with attention and repeated
instantly.’ You may gather, therefore, that <i>Le Secret des
Secrets</i> was not of this order, more especially since he tells
us himself that it would never have been imparted at all
but for the Queen’s, his mistress’s, danger. Plainly, then,
he compiled his book in Queen Mary’s extreme hour of
need, when her neck was beneath her ‘good Sister’s’ heel—and
only in the hope of withdrawing it. Those were
hasty times for all who loved the poor lady; the <i>Secret des
Secrets</i> bears signs of haste. Its author scamped his prologue,
took his title for granted, and plunged off into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
turmoil of his matter like the swimmer who goes to save
life. But you and I, who know something about him by
this time, have intelligence enough to determine whether
he was worthy, or likely to be judged worthy, of the keeping
of a Queen’s heart. So much only I have thought fit
to declare concerning the origin of a curious little book:
for curious it is, partly in the facts it contains, and even
more in the facts it seems to search for—facts of mental
process, as I may call them.</p>

<p>He begins in this manner:—</p>

<p>‘About ten of the clock on the night of the 6th-7th October’—that
is, the reader sees, on the night when Bothwell
kissed her in the Chequer Garden—‘the Queen’s Majesty,
who had been supposed alone, meditating in the garden,
came stilly into the house, passed the hall, up the stair,
and through the anteroom where I, Mr. Erskine, Mistress
Seton and Mistress Fleming were playing at trumps; and
on to her cabinet without word said by any one of us. We
stood up as she came in, but none spake, for her looks and
motions forbade it. She walked evenly and quickly, in a
rapt state of the soul, her head bent and hands clasped
together under her chin, just as a priest will go, carrying
the Sacrament to the bedridden or dying. But presently,
after she was gone, Mistress Fleming went to see whether
she had need of anything; and returned, saying that her
Majesty had been made ready for bed and lain down in
it, without word, without prayers. Shortly afterwards the
ladies went to their beds, and I sat alone in the antechamber
on my duty of the night; and so sitting fell
asleep with my face in my arm.</p>

<p>‘I suppose that it was midnight or thereabout when I
was awakened by a touch on my head, and starting up,
saw the Queen in her bedgown, her hair all loose about
her, standing above me. Being unable to sleep, she said,
she desired company. I asked her, should I read, sing, or
tell her a tale? But she, still smiling, being, as I thought,
in a rapt condition of trance, shook her head. “If you
were to read I should not listen, if you were to sing the
household would wake. Stay as you are,” said she, and
began to walk about the chamber and to speak of a variety<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
of matters, but not at all connectedly. I replied as best I
was able, which was heavily and without wit—for I had
been sound asleep a few moments before. Something was
presently said of my lord of Bothwell: I think that she led
the talk towards him. I said, I marvelled he should stay
so long in Liddesdale, with the Court here in town. She
stopped her pacing and crossed her arms at her neck, as
I had seen her do when she came in from the garden.
Looking closely and strangely at me, she said, “He is not
in Liddesdale. He is here. I have seen him this night.”
Then, as I wondered, she sat down by the table, her face
shaded from the candle by her hand, and regarded me for
some time without speaking.</p>

<p>‘She then said that, although it might seem very extraordinary
to me, she had good reason for what she was
about to do; that for the present I must believe that, and
be sure that she would not impart to me her greatest
secret had she not proved me worthy of the trust. She
then told me, without any more preface, that she
should be called the happiest of women, in that, being
beloved, she loved truly again. She said that she had
been consecrated a lover that very night by a pledge not
only sweet in itself, but sweet as the assurance of all sweetness.
She touched her mouth; and “Yes,” she said, “all
unworthy as I am, this great treasure hath been bestowed
into my keeping. See henceforward in me, most faithful,
proved friend, not your mistress so much as your sister, a
servant even as you are, devoted to the greatest service a
woman can take upon her—subjection, namely, to Love,
that <i>puissant and terrible lord</i>.”</p>

<p>‘While I wondered still more greatly, she grew largely
eloquent. Her soul, she said, was in two certain hands
“like a caught bird”; but such bondage was true freedom
to the generous heart, being liberty to give. She owned
that she was telling me things known to no others but
herself and her beloved. “I am your sister and fellow-servant,”
said she, “whispering secrets in the dark. Marvel
not at it; for women are so made that if they cannot
confide in one or another they must die of the burning
knowledge they have; and I, alas, am so placed that, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
women all about me, and loving women, there is none, no,
not one, in whom I can trust.”</p>

<p>‘I knew already who her lover was, and could not but
agree with her in what she had to admit of her women.
One and all they were against my lord of Bothwell.
Mistress Livingstone hated him so vehemently she could
not trust herself near him; Mistress Fleming was at the
discretion of Mr. Secretary Lethington, a declared enemy
of his lordship’s; Mistress Beaton was wife to a man who
did not deny that he was still the servant of Lady Bothwell;
in Mistress Seton my mistress never had confided.
So she had some reasons for what she was pleased to
do—another being that I, of all her servants, had been
most familiar with his lordship—and I was certain that she
had others, not yet declared. Indeed, she hinted as much
when she said that she had proved me upon a late occasion,
that she loved me, and knew of my love for her. “In
time to come,” said she—“I cannot tell how soon or in
what sort, such matters being out of my hands—I may
have to ask you other service than this of listening to my
confidence; I may require of you to dare great deeds, and
to do them. If you will be my sworn brother, I shall see
in you my champion-at-need, and be the happier for the
knowledge. What say you, then, Baptist?” she asked me.</p>

<p>‘Kneeling before her, I promised that I would keep her
secret and do all her pleasure. I watched her throughout.
She was quite composed, entirely serious, did not seem to
imagine that she was playing a love-sick game—and was
not, altogether. I am sure of that, watching her as I did.
She made me lift my right hand up, and stooped forward
and kissed the open palm before she went away. Here is
the beginning of Mysteries, which I, unworthy servant, was
privileged to share.’</p>

<p>I am not, myself, prepared to say that there is more
mystery in this than the young man put into the telling of
it. She trusted the youth, required an outlet, and made,
in the circumstances, the wisest choice.</p>

<p class="tb">Two days after the performance, at any rate, she set
out for Jedburgh, as you know, in a fine bold humour and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
with a fine company. She went in state and wore her
state manners; rode for the most part between her brother
Moray and the Earl of Huntly, seemed to avoid her women,
and had little to say to them when of necessity they were
with her. She did her bravest to be discreet, and there is
no reason to suppose that anybody about her had more
than an inkling of the true state of her heart. Lord
Bothwell’s leave-taking had been done in public the day
before, and gallantly done. He had been at the pains to
tell her that he was going to his wife, she to smile as she
commended him for his honest errand. She had given
him her hand and wished him well, and had not even
followed him with her looks to the door. The Earl of
Moray, not an observant man by nature, suspected
nothing; what Lord Huntly may have guessed he kept
to himself. This poor speechless, enamoured nobleman!
his trouble was that he kept everything to himself and
congested his heart as well as his head-piece. So much
so that the Queen once confessed to Adam Gordon, his
brother, that she had ‘forgotten he was a lover of hers’!
She spent the first night out at Borthwick, and next morning
rode on to Jedburgh in madcap spirits—which were
destined to be rudely checked by what she met there.
A slap in the face, sharp enough to stop the breath, it was:
news with which the town was humming. It seemed that
the Earl of Bothwell had fought in the hills with Elliot of
Park, had slain his man, and been slain of him.</p>

<p>My Lord Moray was the first to bear her this tale; and
when he told it—just as nakedly as I have put it up there—she
turned upon him a tense, malignant face, and said
that he lied. ‘Madam, I grieve,’ says he—‘my lord of
Bothwell lies dead in Liddesdale.’ ‘O liar, you lie!’ she
said, ‘or God lives not and reigns.’ Many persons heard
her, and saw the proud man flinch; and then Des-Essars,
young Gordon, and Lethington all broke into the room
together, each with his version gathered out of gossip.
My lord was not killed, as had been feared at first, but
sorely wounded, lying at Hermitage, three doctors about
him, and despaired of. ‘One doctor! one doctor!’ cried
Adam, correcting Lethington.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I waited by him,’ says Des-Essars, ‘and then, while
she looked wildly from one face to another, I said that
it was true there was but one doctor, and that the case
was none so desperate. She flew at me. “How do you
know this? How do you know it?” I replied that I
had just got the tale from French Paris. I think she
would have fallen if I had not put my hands out, which
made her draw back in time. “French Paris!” cried she;
“why, then, my lord has sent word. Fly, fly, fly, Baptist:
bring him to me.” This I did, to the great discomfiture
of one, at least, in her company.’</p>

<p>Thus Des-Essars turns his honours to account.</p>

<p>She saw the valet alone, and sent him away with his
pockets lined: afterwards her spirits rose so high that
had Moray noticed nothing he must have been the most
careless of men. She made inordinately much of Des-Essars,
fondling him in all men’s sight; she gave him a
gold chain to hang round his neck, and said, in her
brother’s presence, that she would belt him an earl when
he was older; ‘for thus should the prince reward faithful
service and the spoken truth.’ He affected not to have
heard her—but it was idle to talk of secrets after that.
Here was a rent in the bag big enough for the cat’s head.</p>

<p>And it would appear that she herself was aware of it,
for after a couple of days, just enough time for the
necessary ceremonial business of her coming, she gave
out publicly her intention to ride into Liddesdale, and
her pleasure that Moray, Huntly, and the Secretary
should accompany her. Others would she none, save
grooms and a few archers. My Lord Moray bowed his
head in sign of obedience, but spoke his thoughts to no
man. He kept himself aloof from the Court as much as
he could, in a house of his own, received his suitors and
friends there at all hours, maintained considerable state—more
grooms at his doors than at the Queen’s. Some
thought he was entrenching himself against the day when
his place might be required of him; some thought that
day not far off. All were baffled by the Queen’s choice
of him and his acquiescence.</p>

<p>Betimes in a morning which broke with gales and wild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
fits of weeping from the sky, she set out, going by Bedrule,
Hobkirk, and the shoulder of Windburgh Hill. Nothing
recked she, singing her snatches of French songs, whether
it blew or rained; and the weather had so little mercy on
her that she was wetted through before she had won to
Stitchell—the most southerly spur of a great clump of
land from which, on a fair day, you can look down upon
all Liddesdale and the Vale of Hermitage. There, on
that windy edge, in a driving rain which blew her hair to
cling about and sheathe her face like jagged bronze, she
stayed, and peered down through the mist to see her
trysting-place. But a dense shower blotted out the valleys;
and the castle of the Hermitage lies low, scowling in
shade be the sun never so high. Undaunted still, although
she saw nothing but the storm drowning the lowlands,
it added to her zest that what she sought so ardently lay
down there in mystery. Singing, shaking her head—all
her colours up for this day of hide-and-seek—fine carmine,
gleaming nut-brown eyes, scarlet lips parted to show her
white teeth—she looked a bacchante drunk upon fierce
draughts of weather, a creature of the secret places of the
earth, stung by some sly god. The bit in her teeth,
fretting, shaking her head—who now should rein her up?
Two out of the three men with her watched her closely as
she stood on Stitchell, resolving this doubt; the third, who
was Huntly, would not look at her. Primly pried my
lord of Moray out of the corners of his eyes, and pursed
his lips and ruled his back more than common stiff. But
gloomily looked Mr. Secretary, as he chewed a sour root:
he felt himself too old for such a headlong service as hers
must be, and too weary of schemes to work with Moray
against her. Yet he must choose—he knew it well.
Finely he could read within the chill outlines of that
Master of his destiny all the sombre exhilaration which he
was so careful to hide. ‘He hath set his lures, this dark
fowler; he hath his hand upon the cords. The silly
partridge wantons in the furrow: nearly he hath his great
desire. But what to me are he and his desires, O my God,
what are they to me?’ He thought of Mary Fleming
now at her prayers, thanking her Saviour for the glory of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
his love. His love—Lethington’s love! Lord, Lord, if he
dared to mingle in so fragrant a pasture as hers, what
should he do raking in the midden with an Earl of
Moray? Overdriven, fragile, self-wounding wretch—pity
this Lethington.</p>

<p>It is true that Lord Moray saw the partridge in the
shadow of the net; it is true that he was elated in his
decent Scots way; but you would have needed the trained
eyesight of Lethington to detect the quiver of the nerves.
The Queen broke in upon all reflections, coming towards
them at a canter: ‘Set on, sirs, set on! The hours grow
late, and we cannot see our haven. Come with me,
brother; come, my Lord Huntly.’ Down into the racing
mists they went, squelching through quag and moss.</p>

<p>Hermitage made the best show it could in the
Sovereign’s honour. Every horse in the country was
saddled and manned by some shag-haired Hepburn or
another. Where Hermitage Water joins Liddel they met
her in a troop, which broke at her advance and lined
the way.</p>

<p>No pleasant sight, this, for my lord of Moray. ‘The
Hepburns!’ cried he, when he saw them. ‘Caution,
madam, caution here. What and if they compass a
treachery?’</p>

<p>‘La-la-la,’ says the Queen. ‘Methinks, I should know
a traitor when I see him. Come, my lord, come with me.’
But when he would not, she struck her horse on the flank,
and Huntly spurred to follow her close. Cantering freely
into the midst, she held out her hand, saying, ‘Sirs, you
are well met. Am I well come?’</p>

<p>They closed about her, howling their loyalty, and some
leaned over the saddle-peak to catch at her skirt to kiss it.
She made them free of her hand, let them jostle and
mumble over that; they fought each other for a touch
of it, struck out at horses’ heads to fend them off while
they spurred on their own; they battled, cursed, and
howled—for all the world like schoolboys at a cake. To
Moray’s eyes she was lost, swallowed up in this horde of
cattle-thieves; for he saw the whole party now in motion,
jingling and bickering into the white mist. He lifted up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
a protestant hand. ‘Oh, Mr. Secretar, oh, sir, what
cantrips are these?’</p>

<p>‘She is the Scythian Diana,’ says Lethington, grinning
awry, ‘and these are her true believers. We are dullards
not to have known it.’</p>

<p>‘She is Diana of the Ephesians, I largely gather,’ his
master replied. ‘Come, come, we must follow to the end.’
For his own part, he judged the end not far.</p>

<p class="tb">Her dripping skirts so clung about her—to say nothing
that she was rigid with stiffness and shot all over with
rheumatic pains—she had to be helped from the saddle
and supported by force into the house. A bound victim
of love, tied by the knees! upon Huntly’s arm and
Ormiston’s she shuffled into the hall, and stood in the
midst, boldly claiming hospitable entreaty. It was sorry
to see her eager spirit hobbled to a body so numbed. As
from the trap some bright-eyed creature of the wood looks
out, so she, swaying there on two men’s arms, testified her
incurable hope by colour and quick breath. But calm and
cold, as the moon that rides above a winter night, stood the
Countess of Bothwell with her women, and stately curtsied.</p>

<p>The Queen laughed as she swayed. ‘I am a mermaid,
my child,’ says she, ‘sadly encumbered by my weeds. I
have lost my golden comb, and my witching song is gone
in a croak. You need not fear to take me in.’</p>

<p>The young Countess said, ‘Suffer me conduct your
Majesty to the chambers. All the household stuff is at
your service.’</p>

<p>She shook her head. ‘Witchcraft may come back with
comfort! No, no, my dear, I will not plunder you. I
shall do very well as I am.’ Madness! She was on pin-points
till she saw her lover; but it was not that which
made her refuse warmth and dry clothes. It was a word
of her own, which had turned aside as she used it and
given her a stab. Would she not ‘plunder’ this lady, good
lack? She had a scruple, you perceive.</p>

<p>Tongue-tied Huntly was in great distress. ‘I would
heartily urge you, madam——’ and so forth; and his
sister made the cold addition that all was prepared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span></p>

<p>The Queen was now trembling. ‘You are kind—but I
have no need. I am very well, and cannot stay long.
Let me fulfil my errand—see my wounded councillor—and
depart. Come, take me to him now. Will you do me
this kindness?’ She spoke like a child, with eagerness too
simple to be indecent.</p>

<p>‘I will prepare my lord, madam, for the high honour
you propose him,’ says the Countess, after a moment’s
pause.</p>

<p>‘Yes, yes—go now.’</p>

<p>She went to the fire and held her shaking hands towards
it. Do what she could, there was no staying the shivering-fits,
nor the clouds of steam that came from her, nor the
ring of water round her skirts.</p>

<p>Huntly was miserable. ‘I beseech you, I beseech you,
madam, dry yourself. This is——Oh, but you run into
grave peril. I would that I could make you believe that
all this house is yours, and all hearts in it——’</p>

<p>‘All hearts—all hearts—it may be,’ she said with a
break in her voice; ‘but some there are here with no
hearts. Ah, what heart is in a body that would not find
some pity for me?’</p>

<p>He was dreadfully moved, leaned ardently towards her.
‘Madam! madam! You know my heart—I have never
hid it from you. You talk of pity. Why, is not the
piteous heart acquaint with pitifulness? Ah, then pity
me! Let me serve you.’</p>

<p>Then her ague ceased, and she looked at him full, with
brimming eyes. ‘Take me up to him, Huntly. I cannot
bear myself.’</p>

<p>The fine colour flushed him. ‘Come, madam; I will
take you.’</p>

<p>She followed him up the stair—and the Earl of Moray’s
eyes followed her.</p>

<p class="tb">Here is one difference between imagination and fancy,
that the first will leap full-fledged into the life of the upper
air from the egg of its beginning, while the second crouches
long callow in the nest, and must be fostered into plumage
before it can take its pretty flights. Here, of these two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
who had been separate for a week, she had flown far
beyond the man’s wayfaring, and stood upon a height
which he could scarcely hope to see. To keep touch with
her might call for all his wit. For what had actually
passed between them but a couple of snatched kisses in the
dark? No more, upon his honour, to his sense. For
though he had built upon them a fine castle—with the bricks
of Spain—he would have been the first to own himself a
fool for so doing. But she! Not only had she reared a
fair solid house of chambers and courts, but she had lived
with him in it, a secret life. Here she had had him safe
since the hour he left her in the garden. In her thought
he was bound to her, she to him, by sacraments; they
were, like all lovers, of eternal eld. No beginning and no
end will love own up to. It is necessary to remember this.</p>

<p>Therefore, while he made an effort to get up from the
bed on which he lay strapped, she had prevented him by
running forward and kneeling lover-wise by his side. As
she had hoped, she was now lower than he, nearer the
floor; thence she had looked searchingly in his face, but
said nothing, too full of love, too bashful to begin. The
Countess stood at the bed-head, her brother Huntly
drooped at the foot. The Queen had no eyes for them.</p>

<p>‘Speak to me of your welfare—assure me. I have
been in great grief.’</p>

<p>To this he could only stammer some words of thanks,
not perceiving yet by any means on what side to take her.
But she would have none of his thanks.</p>

<p>‘You must speak to me, for I have dreamed deeply
of this hour. Ah, how they have stricken you!’ She
touched his bandages, lingering about that one upon his
head as if she could not leave it alone. ‘Oh, curious
knife, to search so deep! Oh, greedy Park, to take so
much! But I think I should have taken more—had I
been wiser.’</p>

<p>‘Rise, madam, rise,’ he said, ‘or I must rise. I may
not see you kneeling.’</p>

<p>She laughed. ‘I shall tell you my wicked thought
when I knew that I should see you lying here,’ she said,
‘and then you will not grudge me my knees. No, but you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
shall shrive me again as once before you did—if you are
merciful to poor women.’</p>

<p>As it was evident that she disregarded and would disregard
any company in the room, Huntly began to speak,
with a good deal of dignity. ‘Madam, by your leave——’</p>

<p>She looked about, and saw him ready to quit her.
‘Yes, yes,’ she said, ‘do what you will’; and turned to
her absorbing service.</p>

<p>‘Come, sister,’ says Huntly, and beckoned out the
Countess, who swiftly followed him. He shut the chamber
door.</p>

<p>The Countess had great self-command. ‘Will you tell
me what this means, Huntly?’</p>

<p>He looked at her, knitting his black brows. ‘I think
you know very well, sister.’</p>

<p>As she was walking away from him to her own chamber,
he called her back. She had her hand on the latch.
‘Well?’ she said, ‘what more?’</p>

<p>‘This much,’ said he. ‘You see how it is now with
those two. What you purpose to do in the likely flow of
affairs I know not; but I know my own part. I cannot
forget that I stand debtor to her for my honour, my mere
life, and all my hope in the world. She has suffered, been
very friendless, forsaken oft, betrayed on all hands—mine
among them. She may suffer yet more; but not again by
me, nor I hope by any of my kin. She will be forsaken
again; but I will never forsake her now. She will need
friends in time to come: well, she may reckon upon one.
Long ago I prayed her to trust Gordon, and at the time
she had little cause to do it. Now you shall see her answer
my desire—and not in vain. So much, for all that she
hath forgiven in me, and for all that she hath redeemed for
me—so much, I tell you, I owe her.’</p>

<p>The Countess returned his gaze with no less steadfastness,
from under brows no less serried. ‘And I,’ she said,
‘a Gordon as much as you are, do owe her more than you
choose to acknowledge for your part.’</p>

<p>She went into her chamber; but Huntly remained in
the gallery outside the shut doors.</p>

<h3 id="III_CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="smaller">THE BRAINSICK SONATA</span></h3>

<p>Asked afterwards by his brother-in-law Argyll how he
had survived that long battle homewards through the
howling dark, the Earl of Moray, citing scripture, had
replied, <i>Except the Lord had been on our side</i>—! How far
he strained the text, or how far hoped of it, he did not
choose to say, but in his private mind he thought he saw
all the fruit ready to fall to his hand whenever he should
hold it out. No need to shake the tree. The Queen’s
white palfrey made a false step and went girth-deep into
the moss. None could see her, for she had spurred on
alone into the jaws of the weather, feeling already (it may
be) the fret of the fever in her bones which afterwards
overcame her; nor could any hear her, for she let no cry.
And when the horse, struggling desperately, hinnied his
alarms, it had not been Lord Moray who had hastened to
save. Huntly, rather, it was who, shrieking her name into
the wind, caught at last the faint echo of her voice, and
plunged into the clinging, spongy mess to her rescue.
Alas, then, was she mad? or drunk with love? ‘Here I
am, Mary of Scotland, clogged and trammelled, like a bird
in a net.’ And then, O Lord of Life! she had laughed
snugly and stroked herself—there in the gulf of death.
Huntly, a man for omens, dated all misery to come from
this staring moment.</p>

<p>After it he would not let go of her rein for the rest of
the ride, but braved (as never before) her coaxing, irony,
rage—lastly her tears of mortification. Longing to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
alone with her lover, hating the very shadow of any other
man, she was scathing and unworthy. ‘If Bothwell were
here you would not dare what now you do. You hold me
because there is no man to stop you. It is a brave show
you make of me here! Well, take your joy of numb flesh—how
are you likely to be served with it quick?’ and so
on mercilessly. Towards the end of an intolerable journey
she became drowsy through fatigue, and rather light-headed.
The honest gentleman put his arm round her
and induced her head to his shoulder. She yawned incessantly,
her wits wandered; she spoke to him as if he
were Bothwell, and set his cheeks burning. For a few
minutes at a time, now and again, she slept, while he
supported her as best he could, all his reverent love for
the exquisite, flashing, crowned creature of his memories
swallowed up now in pity for the draggled huntress in
her need.</p>

<p>She was too tired to sleep when, late at night, they had
laid her abed. She tossed, threw her head and arms
about, was hot, was cold, shivered, sweated, wailed to
herself, chattered, sang, whined nonsense. At first the
women, having her to themselves, learned all that she had
been careful to hide from them; all that Huntly had shut
within the chamber door at Hermitage was enacted before
them—or a kind of limping, tragic travesty of it. So then
they grew frightened, and lost their heads: Mary Livingstone
sent after Lord Moray; Mary Fleming called in
Lethington; Mary Seton, with presence of mind, fetched
Des-Essars. Before a keen audience, then, she harped
monotonously and grotesquely upon the day’s doings.
She read scraps of her poems to Bothwell—and few had
known that she had writ any! She wooed him to stoop
down his head, wreathed her arms about a phantom of
him, tortured and reproached herself. All was done with
that straining effort to rehearse which never fails in sickbed
delirium.</p>

<p>‘Ah, wait—wait before you judge me, my lord. I have
a better piece yet—with more of my heart’s blood in the
words. Now, now, how does it go?’ She began to cry
and wring her hands. ‘Oh, give me my coffer before he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
leaves me! This one piece he must have. I wept when
I wrote it—let him see the stain.’ She was running still
upon her poems. Fleming was to give her the little
coffer, of which the key was always round her neck.</p>

<p>Lord Moray was earnest that it should be given her,
but would not let it be seen how earnest. ‘Maybe it will
soothe her to have the coffer. Give it her, mistress,’ he
said.</p>

<p>Des-Essars, seeing his drift, was against it, but of course
could do nothing.</p>

<p>They gave the box into her wandering hands, and she
was quiet for a while, nursing it in her arms; neither
seeking to open it nor trying her memory without it. It
was to be hoped, even now, that she would betray herself
no further.</p>

<p>What need to deny that Lord Moray was curious?
He shook with curiosity. The thing was of the utmost
moment; and it commands my admiration of this patient
man to know that he could be patient still, and sit by his
sick sister’s bed, his head on his hand—and all his hopes
and schemes trembling to be confirmed by a little gimcrack
gilt box. The prize he fought for he got—betraying
nothing, he heard her betray all. When the madness
wrought in her again, she opened the coffer, and began
to patter her verses as she hunted in it, turning paper after
paper (every scrap her condemnation), incapable of reading
any.</p>

<p>Her mind seemed full of words. They came over her
in clouds, flocking about her—clambering, winged creatures,
like the pigeons which crowd and flicker round one who
calls them down. They formed themselves in phrases, in
staves, in verses—laboriously drilled to them, no doubt—once
coherent, but now torn from their sequence, and, like
sections of a broken battle-line, absolutely, not relatively
whole. Simple verse it was, untrained, ill-measured; yet
with a hurt note in it, a cry, a whimper of love, infinitely
touching to read now—but to have heard it then from the
dry lips, to have had it come moaning from the blind,
breathless, insatiable girl! Des-Essars says that he could
scarcely endure it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Las!’ one snatch began—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Las! n’est-il pas ja en possession</div>
<div class="verse">Du corps, du cœur qui ne refuse paine,</div>
<div class="verse">Ny dishonneur, en la vie incertaine,</div>
<div class="verse">Offense de parents, ni pire affliction?</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>What a hearing for my Lord Moray! And again she
broke out falteringly—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Entre ses mains et en son plein pouvoir</div>
<div class="verse">Je metz mon filz, mon honneur et ma vie,</div>

<div class="verse">Suivre je veux malgré toute l’envoie</div>
<div class="verse">Qu’issir en peult....</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Her voice broke here, and with it the thread: she could
not continue, but looked from one to another, tears streaming
down her cheeks, nodded her head at them, and ‘You
know, you know,’ she whimpered, ‘this is the very truth.’
Alas! they could not doubt it.</p>

<p>And then, suddenly, as it were at the parting of a
cloud, her soul looked out of her eyes sanely; she came
to herself, saw the disturbed faces of her friends, and
caught sight of her brother’s among them. She jumped
about as quickly as a caught child, and that lightning,
sentinel wit of hers sprang upon guard. But for a
moment—when she saw Moray there—she betrayed herself.
‘Oh, brother, you startled me!’ she said.</p>

<p>He was careful. ‘Alas! I find you in grief, madam.’</p>

<p>‘Thoughts, brother, thoughts!’</p>

<p>‘Sad thoughts, I fear, madam. We are concerned to
find your Majesty so disturbed.’</p>

<p>She eyed him vaguely, being unable just then to realise
how completely she had yielded him her secret. Extreme
fatigue swam over her; her head nodded even as she
watched him. When Mary Livingstone laid her down
gently and stroked her hair back she drowsed into a
swooning sleep. Over her unconscious form a hasty
little drama was enacting, very curious.</p>

<p>The Earl of Moray, seeing her hold relaxed, rose quietly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
from his chair and stretched one of his hands towards the
gilt coffer. Des-Essars, in a flash of thought, nudged
Huntly. ‘Quick,’ he whispered—‘take the coffer’; and
Huntly whipped his arm out and reached it first. Moray
drew back, as a cat his paw from a wetness, and shuddered
slightly. Huntly says, in a low voice: ‘Monsieur Des-Essars,
I give this casket in your charge until her Majesty
shall give direction. It is open. Come with me and I
will seal it.’</p>

<p>Moray was not the man to forgive such a thing in the
Queen’s page; nor did he ever.</p>

<p class="tb">She was awake and fully conscious for a few hours of
the next day. Father Lesley, an old friend, was allowed
to see her, and needed not the evidence of physic, ticks of
the pulse, heat of the blood: he could use his senses.</p>

<p>He warned her of her extremity. This was a grave
matter, graver than she might suppose. Her eyes turned
upon him, black and serious; but then, after a little, she
smiled up saucily in his face. ‘Why, I hope,’ she said,
‘there is no need to fear death—if death it be. I am sure
my friends will plead kindly for me, and as for my
enemies, what can they say worse than they have said?’</p>

<p>‘The Christian, ma’am,’ says Lesley, ‘has no concern
with friend or foe at such a time. The road he must
travel, he will have no arm to bear upon, save the proffered
arm of the Cross.’</p>

<p>‘True,’ she said. ‘I hope I shall die a Christian, as I
have tried to live.’</p>

<p>Her mind must have been preternaturally sharp, for a
chance word of the admonition which he thought good to
deliver set it to work. ‘Likewise it behoveth the Christian,
madam—so strict an account is required of the highly
favoured—to repent him of the mischances of sleep and
dreams. Unlawful, luxurious dreaming, the mutterings of
sinful words when our bodies lie bound in slumber are
stumbling-blocks to the soul agog to meet his Saviour at
the gate.’</p>

<p>He rambled on and on, the godly ignoramus, the while
her wits flew far. Mutterings of dreams—had she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
betrayed herself? Then—to whom? It behoved her to
be certain. She bundled out the priest and had in the
confidant. From Des-Essars she learned the extent of her
delirium; he brought her the casket, unlocked, sealed by
the Chancellor, from which, he told her, she had read
‘certain sonnets.’ Love-laden lady! she stopped him
here, laughing as she fingered her coffer, lifting and
snapping-to the lid. ‘My sonnets? They are here, many
and many. I shall read them to him some day. And to
you some. Shall I——?’</p>

<p>Positively, she was about to begin, but he implored her
to lock up the box of mischief and secrete it somewhere.</p>

<p>‘Guard it for me, my dear,’ she said. ‘What else have
I done in my fever?’</p>

<p>He told her, many hidden matters had been disclosed,
as well of the King as of others. It was not for him to
say that nothing was left unrevealed; only that he knew
of nothing. She had spoken, for instance, of a token, and
had pointed to where it lay. Her eyes sparkled as she
flashed out her hand from under the bedclothes, holding
forth a ring upon a chain. ‘Here it is! He gave it me
himself, and fastened it upon me with a kiss.’</p>

<p>‘Ha!’ He was frightened. ‘Let me keep it safe for
you, madam, until——’</p>

<p>‘Safe? Will they cut it from my body, think you?
Never, never. You shall watch over my casket, but this is
a part of me.’</p>

<p>He makes free to comment upon this episode. ‘And I
confess,’ he says, ‘that I exulted in her constant noble
courage, and found nothing amiss in it, that she had stooped
from her high estate. Rather I held it matter for praise
and excitation of the thought and sense. For, properly
viewed, there is nothing of beauty more divine than holy
humility, nor hath there ever been since once the Lord of
Glory and Might bowed His sacred head.’</p>

<p>But when she would have had him devise with her fresh
methods of concealment, dust-throwing, head-burying, and
the like, he told her fairly that it was too late.</p>

<p>‘I am bold to assure your Majesty that there is no man
nor woman about this Court that wots not throughly of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
your Majesty’s private affairs. And, madam, if Dolet, if
Carwood, if Mistress Fleming and Mistress Seton talk to
each other of them over the hearth, what think you can be
hidden from my lord of Moray—to say not that he hath
been constant at your bedside, and hath heard you cry
verses?’</p>

<p>Pondering these fateful truths, suddenly she tired of
shifts. ‘Well, then, come what may of it,’ she cried out,
‘let them whisper their fill. I have done with whispering.’</p>

<p>She said that she wished to sleep—had the maids in
and composed herself to that end. About midnight she
awoke terribly in pain; shivering, crying aloud that her
hour was come, unable to turn. The doctors were called
to her, all the house was broad awake. She began after
a time to vomit blood, and so continued for a night, a day
and a night, shaken to pieces and at her last gasp.</p>

<p>Under this new agony she weakened so fast that the
crying aloud of secrets stopped for mere weakness: all
believed that she must die. The Earl of Moray, who had
kept aloof after his fierce little struggle with Huntly, now
assumed the direction of affairs, none staying him. He
took upon himself to send for the King, that being his
duty, as he said, to the State. The duty was not to be
denied, though there was peril in it.</p>

<p>‘I fear, my lord,’ said Lethington, ‘I fear the effect of
the King’s presence upon her Majesty’s frail habit.’</p>

<p>Lord Huntly roundly said that any ill effect from such a
measure would lie at his colleague’s door. ‘And I marvel
much, my lord of Moray, that you, who have heard her
Majesty’s wandering speech and know the extremes of her
dislike, should have proposed to call hither the one person
left in Scotland whom she hath reason at once to reproach
and fear.’</p>

<p>Moray waved his hand. ‘The Queen, my sister, is at
death’s door. And will you tell me who has so much right
to lead her to it as her husband?’</p>

<p>‘To drive her to it, belike your lordship means!’ cried
Huntly as he flung out of the room. His counter-stroke
was to send word over to the Hermitage. Let Bothwell
make haste. Adam Gordon took the message.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span></p>

<p>But before either King or lover could be looked for there
dawned a day upon Jedburgh, upon the darkened grey
house in the Wynd, which the Queen herself believed to be
her last. She was in that state of the body when the
ghostly tenant, all preened for departure, has clear dominion,
and earthly affections and earthly cares are
ridded and done with. In other words, she had forgotten
Bothwell.</p>

<p>She confessed to Father Roche and received the Sacrament;
she kissed her Maries—all there but Lady Boyne,
who had been Beaton; called the lords about her and
looked gently in the face of each in turn—not asking of
them any more, but enjoining, rather, and as if requiring.
‘My lords, under the wise hands of God I lie waiting here,
and what I speak is from the verge of the dark. Serve, I
desire you, the prince my son, remembering his tender
helpless years, and dealing patiently with his silly understanding.
Be not harsh with them that are left of the old
religion: you cannot tax me with severity to your own.
Let Scotland serve God in peace, every man after his own
conscience. I am too weak to command, and have no
breath to spare for beseeching. My lords, this is my last
desire. Is there any here who will refuse me?’</p>

<p>She looked about from one strong face to another; saw
Huntly crying, Argyll struggling to keep tears back,
Lethington with his head bowed down, as if he would pray.
She saw her half-brother John Stuart watching her from
under his brows; lastly her half-brother Moray, whose
face, fixed and blanched, told her nothing. Sighing, she
raised herself. Here was one for her dying breath, for one
last cajolery! She put up her hand to touch his, and he
started as if suddenly awakened, but commanded himself.</p>

<p>‘Brother,’ she said, in a whisper half audible, ‘oh, brother,
vex none in Scotland, for my sake.’</p>

<p>He stooped, took up and kissed her hand; and she let it
fall with a long sigh of content. Presently after, she
straightened herself, as if conscious of the near end, joined
her palms together, and began the Creed in a sharp, painful
voice quite unlike her own, fantastic and heart-piercing at
once. In the middle she stopped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span></p>

<p>‘<i>Qui propter nos homines et propter—et propter</i>——I
misremember the rest——’</p>

<p>‘<i>Salutem</i>, madam, ’tis <i>nostram salutem</i>,’ says Father
Lesley, with a sob.</p>

<p>‘God give it me, a sinner,’ she said, and turned her
cheek to the pillow, and lay caught and still. The physician
put his hand to her heart, and made a sign. Lesley
tiptoed to the windows and set them open.</p>

<p class="tb">The Earl of Moray lifted up his head. ‘I fear, my
lords, that the worst is come upon us. The Queen, my
sister—alas!’ He covered his eyes for a moment, then, in
a different tone and a changed aspect, began to give order.
‘Mr. Secretary, cause messengers to ride to Glasgow to the
prince’s father. My Lord Chancellor, you should convene
a council of the estates. Doctor, I must have a word
with you.’</p>

<p>By these sort of phrases he sent one and all flocking to
the door like sheep about a narrow entry. Des-Essars
lingered about, but what could he do? The Earl’s cold
eye was upon him.</p>

<p>‘You, sir—what do you here? I will deal with you anon.
Meantime, avoid a matter which is not for you.’</p>

<p>The lad went out, hanging his head.</p>

<p>Last to go were the weeping maids and Father Roche,
the Queen’s Confessor, who, before he left her, placed his
crucifix under her closed hand.</p>

<p>This too was observed. ‘Take up your idol, sir,’ said
Lord Moray; ‘take back your idol. Suchlike are vain things.’</p>

<p>But Father Roche took no notice of him, and went away
without his crucifix.</p>

<p>The physician had remained, a little twinkle-eyed man,
with white eyebrows like cornices of snow. He curved and
raised them before the greatest man in Scotland.</p>

<p>‘You need me, my lord?’</p>

<p>‘I do not at this present. Await my summons in the
anteroom.’</p>

<p>He was alone with the passing soul, which even now
might be adrift by the window, streaming out to its long
flight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span></p>

<p>He looked sharply and seriously about the room,
omitting nothing from his scrutiny. There stood the
writing-desk in the window, covered in geranium leather,
with stamped ciphers in gold upon it, <i>F</i> and <i>M</i> interlaced,
the Crown-royal of France above them. He stole to it and
tried it: locked. He lifted it from the table, put it on the
floor under the vallance of the bed, then went on searching
with his keen eyes.</p>

<p>These winning him nothing, he moved softly about and
tried one or two likely coverts—the curtains, the vallance;
moved a hand-mirror, disturbed some books, a cloak upon
a chair. He was puzzled, he put his hand to his mouth,
bit his finger, hesitating. Presently he crept up to the bed
and looked at her who lay there so still. He could see by
the form she made that she was crouched on her side with
her knees bent, and judged it extraordinary, and talked to
himself about it. ‘They lie straighter—down there. They
prepare themselves——Who would die twisted? What
if the soul——?’ His heart gave him trouble. He stopped
here and breathed hard.</p>

<p>The hand that held the crucifix—it was the right hand—was
out: it showed a ring upon one finger, only one.
The left hand he could not see—but it was very necessary
to be seen. Gingerly he drew back the bedclothes, slowly,
tentatively, then more boldly. They were away: and
there lay the casket, enclosed within the half-hoop of the
body. That she should have tricked him in her dying
agony was a real shock to him, and, by angering, gave him
strength. He reached out his hand to take it—he touched
it—stopped, while his guilty glance sought her grey face.
O King Christ! he saw her glimmering eyes, all black,
fixed upon him—with lazy suspicion, without wink of eyelid
or stir of the huddled body to tell him whether she lived
or was dead. His tongue clove to his palate—he felt
crimson with shame: to rob the dead, and the dead to see
him! After a pause of terrible gazing he stepped backwards,
and back, and back. He felt behind him, opened
the door, and called hoarsely: ‘The Queen lives! She
lives! Come in—come in!’</p>

<p>The passages were alive in an instant, doors banged,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
feet scampered the stairs. The first person to come in was
Des-Essars, turned for the moment from youth to Angel of
Judgment. He dashed by Moray, threw himself upon the
Queen’s coffer, snatched it, and with it backed to the wall.
There, with his arms about it, he stood at bay, panting and
watching the enemy.</p>

<p>But the room was now full. Women, crowded together,
were all about the bed. In the midst knelt the doctor
by the Queen. Huntly, Lethington, Argyll, and Erskine
stood grouped.</p>

<p>‘What have you, Baptist, in your hands?’ says
Huntly.</p>

<p>‘It is her Majesty’s treasure, my lord, which you committed
to my keeping.’</p>

<p>‘Where gat you it, man?’ asked Argyll.</p>

<p>But before he could be answered my Lord Moray lifted
up hand and voice. ‘Let all them,’ he said, ‘that are of
Christ’s true Church give thanks with me unto God for
this abounding mercy.’</p>

<p>Lethington, Argyll, some of the women, stood with
covered faces while his lordship prayed aloud. Huntly
watched the Queen, and presently got his great reward.
Her eyes were turned upon him; she knew him, nodded
her head and smiled. He fell to his knees.</p>

<p class="tb">So quick her recovery, in two days’ time there was no
more talk of the piece of Scotland or of the Credo half-remembered.
The earth and the men of the earth resumed
their places and re-pointed their goads; as she grew
stronger so grew her anxieties. Lord Bothwell sent, by
Adam Gordon (who had gone to fetch him) his humble
duty to her Majesty, ‘thanking God hourly for her recovery.’
His physicians, he said, would in no wise suffer him attempt
the journey as yet—no, not in a litter. The Queen chafed,
and wrote him querulous letters; but nothing would tempt
him out. She got very few and very guarded replies, so
fell to her sonnets again.</p>

<p>The truth is, that the Earl of Bothwell, having set his
hand to a business which, if temperately handled, promised
most fair, kept rigidly to the line he had thought out for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
himself; and thus affords the rare example of a man who,
by nature advancing upon gusts of passion, can keep
himself, by shrewd calculation, to an orderly gait. The
means to his end which he had appointed, and took, were
of the most singular ever used by expectant lover—to
French Paris, for instance, they were a cause of dismay—and
yet they succeeded most exactly. They were, in fact,
<i>to do nothing at all</i>. He had found out by careful study of
the lady that the less he advanced the farther she would
carry him, the less he asked for the more she would lay at
his feet, the less he said the larger her interpretation of his
hidden mind. She was a fine, sensitive instrument—like a
violin, now wounded, now caressed by the bow, shrieking
when he slashed at the strings, sobbing when he plucked
them with callous fingers, moaning when he was gentle,
shrilling when he so chose it. In a word, he had to deal
with loyalty, extreme generosity, a magnanimity which
knew nothing of the sale and exchange of hearts. He had
known this for some years; he now based his calculations
upon it without ruth—the last person in the world to whom
her magnificent largess could appeal; and (as French Paris
would say) of the last nation in the world. To a man like
him the gift only imports, not the giving. It is an actuary’s
question; while to her and her kind the act is the whole
of the matter: deepest shame were to know herself rich in
one poor loincloth while he had a bare patch whereon to
hang it. She was that true Prodigal, most glorious when
most naked.</p>

<p>Des-Essars, alone in her confidence during these hours
of strain, makes an acute deduction. ‘Her letters of this
time will show very plainly,’ he says, ‘that she was brought
by his chill silence to that extreme point of desire where
<i>sacrifice and loss seem the top of bliss</i>. It was no longer
a man that she longed for, but an Act. Fasting for a
Sacrament, the bread and wine of her need was Surrender.
I say that this fond distress of hers, these absorbed eyes
filled often with tears for no reason, her suspense when waiting—and
vainly—for a messenger’s return; her abandonment
before the altar, her cries in the night—such things,
I say, were reasonable to me, and to all who, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
Florentine’s phrase, have “understanding of love.” But to
the Court it seemed unreasonable.’</p>

<p>Unreasonable! It seemed perverse, unspeakable. The
maids were dumb with shame. The one thing which Mary
Fleming would not discuss with Lethington, or allow him
to discuss in her hearing, was the Queen’s disease. Mary
Livingstone went about like one in a trance—sand-blind,
stumbling after some elfin light. She spoke to none,
remembered none. Judge the feelings of her Master of
Sempill, who could tell his friends in England nothing!
Mary Seton, too, kept her pretty lips locked up. Once,
when Fleming pressed her,—what time they were abed—she
said shortly: ‘I am her servant, and shall be till I die.
If you are her judge, I know it not. You are none of
mine.’</p>

<p>‘No, no, no!’ cried poor Fleming. ‘You wrong me.
Who am I to judge?’</p>

<p>‘Who indeed?’ said Mary Seton, and turned over.</p>

<p>The Court was divided in these harassing days, because
the Earl of Moray drew off a large proportion of it to his
own house. Thither resorted Argyll, Glencairn and Atholl,
my lord of Mar when he could, and Lethington when he
dared; there also and always was the Lord Lindsay, that
blotched zealot, with his rumpled hair and starched frill.
Huntly, of course, held closely by the Queen, refusing to
admit the second Court; Lord Livingstone was faithful, as
became the father of Mary Sempill. He rubbed his
chapped hands over the fire, and cried three times a day
that all was well: a folly so palpable that everybody
laughed. Lesley stayed by her, a tearful spectacle; Lord
Herries too, very gloomy. Such state as there was—and
it was draggled state—Arthur Erskine and Traquair
maintained; but the Queen was quite unconscious of state.
Royal dignity had never been a virtue of hers; she was
always either too keen or too dejected to have time for it.
Whether old Lord Livingstone treated her jocosely, or old
Lord Mar with implied reproof in every grating search for
a word—if Bothwell had written she did not heed them;
and if he had not, she sat watching for French Paris at the
window, and still did not heed them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span></p>

<p>And undoubtedly old Lord Livingstone was jocose—abounded
in nods and winks. ‘Just a fond wife,’ he described
her to his friends, and so treated her to her face.
It is to be believed, had she heard it, that she would have
been proud of the title. So, during the misty short days
and long wet nights of October she cheapened herself
in Love’s honour, and was held cheap by Scotch
thickwits.</p>

<p class="tb">On the night of the 28th of the month the King came
to see her. He arrived very late, and departed in a fury
within the twenty-four hours. His clatter, his guards, his
horses and himself filled the town; he took up lodging in
the Abbey, and caused himself to be announced by heralds
at the lowly door of the Queen’s House.</p>

<p>Perhaps she was worn out by watching for another
comer; perhaps she was ill, perhaps angry—it is not to be
known. She would hardly notice him when he came in;
spoke languidly, dragging her words, and would not on
any account be alone with him. He demanded, as his
right, that her women should leave her; she raised her
eyebrows, not her eyes, until he repeated his desire in a
louder voice.</p>

<p>Then she said, ‘What right have you kept, what right
have you ever done, that you should have any rights left
you here?’</p>

<p>‘Madam, I have every right—that of a father, that of a
consort—’</p>

<p>‘You have waived it—refused it—denied it—and
betrayed it.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, never, never!’</p>

<p>‘Twice, sir, to my bitter cost.’</p>

<p>He laughed harshly to hear such words. ‘Sirs,’ he said
to those with him, ‘I see how it is. Rumour for once is no
fibster.’</p>

<p>‘Come away, my lord, come your ways,’ said old Livingstone.
‘You will do harm to yourself.’</p>

<p>He cried out, ‘None shall dictate to me in this realm.’</p>

<p>And then Moray said, ‘Sir, I would seriously advise you—for
your good——’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span></p>

<p>The King stared at him, gibed at him. ‘If you seek
my good, my lord, God judge me, ’tis for the first
time.’</p>

<p>‘It is the good of us all,’ said Moray. ‘Her Grace is
overwrought. Let me entreat your patience. This coming
is something sudden, though so long attended. In the
morning maybe——’</p>

<p>The King threatened. ‘And what is this but the morn?
The morn! The morn’s morn I depart with the light, and
for long time—be you sure of that.’</p>

<p>He kept his word; and she, proud of her loyalty, wrote
to her lover how constant she had been. ‘He would have
stayed did I but nod. Guess you how stiff I kept my
head.’ That touching sentence brought Lord Bothwell
hot-foot to Jedburgh—to find her waiting for him at the
head of the stair.</p>

<p>She could hardly suffer him to come into the room: her
longing seemed to choke her. ‘You have come to praise
me—O generous lover! You can trust me now! Oh, tell
me that I have been faithful!’</p>

<p>He turned shortly and shut the door. Then, ‘Madam,’
he said bluntly, ‘I cannot praise you at all, though I
must not presume to do otherwise.’</p>

<p>She paled at that, and smiled faintly, as if to show him
that the pain could be borne.</p>

<p>‘I am very dull, my lord. Speak plainly to me.’</p>

<p>So indeed he did. ‘You should at all costs have kept
him by you. At all costs, madam, at all costs. Here we
could have dealt with him—but now——!’ He stopped
an exclamation of fury, just in time. ‘And who can tell
whether he will try you again?... Oh, it was ill judged.
I regret it.’</p>

<p>She pored upon his face, wonder fanning her eyes. ‘You
regret my faith! Regret my honour, saved for you!
Strange griefs, my lord.’</p>

<p>‘I regret ill policy. The man is treasonable up to the
ears: there were many ways of doing. Now there are
none at all. Gone, all gone! What have I dared to pray
for—what you have deigned to offer me; what my ears
have heard and my eyes seen—all that my senses have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
lured me to believe: this one act of your Majesty’s has
belied! Ah!’ He dug his heel into the carpet. He
folded his arms. ‘Well, it is not for me to reproach my
Sovereign, or to complain that her realm holds one fool the
more. The Lord gives and takes away—pshaw! and why
not the Lady?’</p>

<p>She stretched out her arms to him, there being none to
stay her. ‘Oh, what are you saying? Is it possible?’
She came close, she crept, touched his face. ‘If you doubt
me I must die. Prove me—behold me here. Take me—I
am yours.’</p>

<p>‘No, madam,’ he snarled like a dog, ‘a pest upon it!
You are not mine: you are his.’</p>

<p>She sank down, kneeling by the table, and hid her face.
Murmuring some excuse, that she was overwrought, that
he would fetch women, he left her and went directly to
Lord Moray’s house. There he found Lethington.</p>

<p>‘The Queen is very ill, as it seems to me,’ he said, ‘nor
is it hard to see where is the core of her malady. If that
loon from Glasgow comes ruffling before her again, I
shall not be able to answer for what I may do. Tell you
that to my lord, I care not; nay, I desire you to tell him.
We should be friends, he and I, for we now have one aim
and one service, and as sworn servants should do our duty
without flinching. I commit these thoughts to you,
Lethington, that you and I, with your patron here, may
take counsel together how best to serve the Queen with a
cure for her disease. It is indurate, mark you; we may
need to cut deep; but it becomes not men to falter. You
and I have had our differences, which I believe to be sunk
in this common trouble. We may be happy yet—God
knows. Devise something, devise anything, and you shall
not find me behindhand. Let there be an end of our
factions. Why, man, there are but two when all’s said—the
Queen’s and that other’s. Count me your friend in
any occasion you may have. Farewell. You will find me
at Hermitage.’</p>

<p>Lethington was greatly moved. ‘Stay, my lord, stay,’
he said, coming forward with propitiatory hands. ‘My
lord of Moray will receive you.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I can’t stay. There are good reasons for going, and
none for staying—now that that fellow is safe in Glasgow
again. Let my lord do his part and call upon me for mine.
When do you wed, Lethington?’</p>

<p>The Secretary blushed. ‘It stands with the Queen’s
pleasure, my lord. My mistress would never fail hers, and
so I must be patient.’</p>

<p>‘Hearken, my good friend,’ said Bothwell, with a hand
on his shoulder. ‘I am pretty well in her Majesty’s favour,
I believe. Now, if a word from me——’</p>

<p>‘Upon my soul, I am greatly obliged to your lordship.’</p>

<p>‘Say no more, man. You shall be sped to church.
Farewell.’</p>

<p>He rode fast to Hermitage that day, and threw himself
upon his bed. They told him that the Countess was
asleep.</p>

<p>‘Why, then,’ says he, ‘she shall have her sleep while
she can.’</p>

<p>As he had expected, he got a letter next noon, with
tears upon it, had he cared to look for them, and in every
stiff clause a cry of the heart....</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I submit myself henceforward wholly unto you.... In you
is all my hope, my only friend, without whom I cannot endure....
Prove me again: I shall not fail you. All this night I have
kept watch while the world is asleep. Now I am very sure I shall
not fail again. Sir, if I think apart, it is because I dwell apart;
but if I may trust you that shall be amended. I pray it be. But
I hear you say, It is for yourself to deal in it. Again I beseech
your patience if I am slow to learn how best to please you. My
tutors and governors praised me as a child for aptness to learn.
Now the lessons grow sharper and I the more dull....</p>

<p>My brother came to visit me this few hours since. He spake
kindly of you, and of him<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> as the sole mischief-worker here. I
answered as I thought myself free to do, but now misdoubt me,
fearful of your displeasure. You used harsh punishment towards
me: I feel sore beaten, as with rods. If I sleep I shall be the
stronger for it; but that is easy said. Now if I write Alas! you
may scorn me; and yet I feel directed to no other word, save<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
Welladay! Sir, if it should stand within your pleasure to give
pleasure to your friend, you will reply by this bearer; in whom
you may trust as much as I ask you to trust</p>

<p class="center">Your discomfited, perfect friend</p>

<p class="right">M. R.</p>

<p>He answered coldly, but with great respect, and only
kept the messenger back two days.</p>

<h3 id="III_CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="smaller">DESCANT UPON A THEME AS OLD AS JASON</span></h3>

<p>It is from Des-Essars that I borrowed that similitude of
Lord Bothwell to a violin-player. The young man pictures
him as such, at this very time, sitting deep in his chair at
the Hermitage, his instrument upon his crossed knee—his
lovely, sensitive instrument! He screws at the keys, in
his leisurely, strong way, and now and again plucks out a
chord, ‘until, under the throbbing notes, he judges that he
hath wrung up his music to the tragic pitch.’ The figure
is adroit in its fitness to the persons involved, but puzzling
in this respect—that with executant so deliberate and
instrument so fine the pitch should be so slow of attainment.</p>

<p>Face the facts, as she herself did (with a shiver of self-pity),
and ask yourself what on earth he was about. Consider
his fury at her dismissal of the King, his coldness
through her appeals for mercy: what could they point to
but one thing? ‘Over and over again,’ says Des-Essars,
‘my mistress told me that his lordship would do nothing
overt while the King her husband was alive; and I
acquiesced in silence. It was too evident. She added,
immediately, “And I, Baptist—what can I do? What
will become of me? I cannot live without my Beloved—nay,
I cannot discern life or death under the canopy of
Heaven unless he is there moving and directing it. As
well ask me to behold a vista of days in which the sun
should never shine. This is a thing which forbids thought,
for it denies the wish to live.” To such effect she expressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
herself often, and then would remain silent, as to be sure
did I, each of us, no doubt, pondering the next question
(or its answer)—What stood in the way of her happiness?
What kept the King alive? The answer lay on the tip of
the tongue. She! She only preserved the worthless life;
she only stood in her own light. Ah, she knew that well
enough, and so did I, and so did every man in Scotland
save one—the blind upstart himself.</p>

<p>‘A dangerous knowledge, truly: dangerous by reason
of the ease with which she could provide remedy for her
pain. Let her move a finger, let her wink an eyelid, shrug
a shoulder, and from one side or another would come on a
king’s executioner, clothed in the livery of Justice, Proper
Resentment, Vengeance, Envy, Greed or Malice—for under
one and all of these ensigns he was threatened by death.
And I will answer for it that the question flickered hourly
in flame-red letters before her eyes, Why standeth the
Queen of Scots in the way of Justice? O specious enemy!
O reasonable Satan! What! this fellow, a drunkard, a
vile thing, treacherous, a liar, a craven—this, whom to kill
were to serve God, alone to shut her out from good days?
I know that her hand must have itched to give the signal;
I know that the Devil prevailed; but not yet, not yet
awhile—not till she was reeling, faint, caught up, swirled,
overwhelmed by misery and terror. At this time, though
suffering made her eyes gaunt and her mouth to grin, she
kept her hands rigidly from any sign.</p>

<p>‘It is, withal, a curious thing, not to be disregarded by
the judicious, that the Countess of Bothwell, and her claims
and pretentions, never entered her thoughts. In her
opinion, women—other women—were the toys of men.
This world of ours she saw as a garden, a flowery desert
place in which stood two persons, the Lover and the
Beloved. Observe this, you who read the tale; for presently
after my Lord Bothwell observed it, and, by playing
upon it, attuned her to his tragic pitch.’</p>

<p class="tb">She left Jedburgh on 10th November, her terrible beleaguering
question not yet answered. She went a kind
of progress by the Tweed valley, by Kelso, Wark, Hume,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
Langton, Berwick, stayed in the gaunt houses which are
still to be seen fretting the ramparts of that lonely road—towers
reared upon woody bluffs to command all ways of
danger, square, turreted fortresses looking keenly out upon
the bare lands which they scarcely called their own and
had grown lean in defending. All about her as she went
were the lords, every man of them with his own game in
his head, watching the moves of every other. Argyll and
Glencairn were shadows of Moray; Crawfurd and Atholl
for the moment held with Huntly and the throne. Lethington
was the dog of whoso would throw him a task;
Livingstone, jocular still, kept mostly with the women.</p>

<p>The Queen’s moods, as she journeyed slowly through
that wintering country, changed as the weather does in
late autumn. Winds blow hot and winds blow cold,
tempests are never far off; frost follows, when the sun
glitters but is chill, and the ice-splinters lie late, like
poniards in the ridged ways. She rode sometimes for a
whole day in bitter silence, her face as bleak as the upland
bents, and sometimes she spurred furiously in front, her
hair blown back and face on fire with her mad thoughts.
Unseen of any, she clenched her fists, she clenched her
teeth. ‘I am a queen, a queen! I choose to do it. It is
my right, it is my need.’</p>

<p>She had fits of uncontrollable weeping; they caught her
unawares now and then, her face all blurred with tears.
This was when she had been pitying herself as victim of
a new torment—new at least to her. ‘He sits alone with
a woman who hates me. He pinches her chin—they laugh
together over my letters. Fool! I will write no more.’
The more a fool in that she wrote within the next hour.</p>

<p>When she grew frightened to find how solitary she was,
she turned in the saddle more than once, and hunted all
faces for a friendly one. Wearisome quest, foredoomed to
failure! Moray, with his straight rock of brow, sat like a
cliff, looking steadfastly before him; Argyll counted the
sheep on the hillside; Livingstone, a ruddy old fool,
hummed a tune, or said, ‘H’m, h’m! All’s for the best
in this braw world, come rain come sun.’</p>

<p>And the maids, the Maries, once her bosom familiars!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
There Livingstone bites her prudish lip, here Fleming peers
askance at Lethington; Seton says something sharply
witty to Lady Argyll, and makes the grim lady hinny like
a mare.</p>

<p>Far behind, in the ruck of the cavalcade, she may catch
sight of a youth on a jennet, a pale-faced youth with a
widish nose and smut-rimmed light eyes. He has a
French soul; he loves her. There, at least, is one that
judges nothing, condemns nothing, approves nothing. She
is she, and he her slave. Is she angry?—The sun’s hidden
then. Does she smile?—The sun rises. Does she kiss
him?—Ho! the sun atop of summer. Suppose that she
were Medea: suppose for a moment that she slew—no, no,
the term is inexact—suppose that she stood aside, and
men justly offended came in and slew King Jason? This
slave of hers would say, ‘The sun, shining, hath struck one
to earth.’</p>

<p>Yes, here was a trusty friend who would as soon blame
the sun for his sunstroke, or the lightning for his flash of
murder, as blame her. She would call him to her, then,
and make him ride by her for half a day. She would take
his hand, lean aside to kiss him, to rest her head on his
shoulder, to stroke his cheek; she would call him her lover,
her fere, her true and perfect knight—fool him, in fine,
to the top of his bent. And to all that she said or did,
Des-Essars, if we may believe him, decently replied: ‘Yes,
it is quite true that I love your Majesty. I have no other
thought but that, nor have I ever had.’</p>

<p>Thus she rode progress towards her soul’s peril, changing
from fierce heat to shrivelling cold as fast as the autumn
weather.</p>

<p>It was at Kelso that she got letters from the King, foolish
and blusterous letters in the <i>Quos ego ...!</i> style which the
Master of Sempill admired. Let her Majesty understand
his mind was made up. Let her Majesty receive him in
Edinburgh, or ... this was their tenor; with them in her
hand and one from Bothwell burning in her bosom she
showed Mr. Secretary a disturbed, dangerous face. Pale
as she was nowadays, and thin, he was shocked to see her
hungry lines. He thought her like some queen of old,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
Jocasta or Althæa, with whom the Furies held midnight
traffic. ‘Do you see this? Is it never to end?’</p>

<p>He did not stay to peruse the letters. ‘Madam,’ he
said, ‘let us take order in these painful matters. Leave
them to your faithful friends, and all shall be to your
contentation.’</p>

<p>She turned away; her staring eyes saw nothing but
misery. ‘Take order, say you? If you fear so much as to
speak above a whisper, how shall you dare do anything?
Friends! what friend have I but one? Death is my
patient, waiting friend; and so I shall prove him before
many more days.’</p>

<p>‘Alas, madam, speak not so wildly.’</p>

<p>She looked fiercely, wrinkling up her eyes at him. ‘But
I tell you, sir, that if this load be not lifted from me, I shall
end it my own way.’</p>

<p>That night a plan was laid before the Earls of Moray
and Argyll. Lethington spoke it, but Huntly stood over
him as stiffly imminent as a pine, or he had never found a
word to say.</p>

<p>After a great deal of elliptic talk he came to terms, by
saying, ‘The business can be done promptly and without
scandalous parade of force. When her Majesty is at
Craigmillar making ready for the Prince’s baptism, he will
certainly come, for he would never endure to be passed
over at such a time, when the ambassadors of France and
England may be brought to acknowledge him. Well, then,
my lords, if we confront him with our proofs of his oft-meditated
treason he will deny them. If we essay to
apprehend him he will resist us; and resistance, doubtless,
might provoke our men to—to——’ Here he looked
about him.</p>

<p>‘You have said enough, Lethington,’ Huntly broke in.
‘We shall be ready, those of us who are true men.’ He
watched Moray darkly as he spoke, but drew forth no reply.
It was Argyll who took up the talk—took it up to the
rafters as it were, since he leaned back in his chair and cast
up his eyes.</p>

<p>‘Look at him for a Lennox Stuart, God help us!
Lennox Stuart and rank Papist he is. To leave at large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
the like of that is to have a collie turned rogue ranging
your hillside. Why, gentlemen,’ and he looked from man
to man, ‘shall we leave him to raven the flock?’</p>

<p>‘I adhere to the plan,’ said Huntly. ‘Count upon me
and mine. I take it you stand in with us, my Lord of
Argyll. What says my Lord of Moray?’</p>

<p>The great man became judicial. He gave them the
feeling, as he intended, that he had been surveying a far
wider field than they could scan. Under that arching sky,
which he was able to range in, and from whose study they
had called him down, their little schemes took up that just
inch which was their proper scope. If he had not remarked
them earlier, not his the all-seeing eye; but he was obliged
to his friends for drawing him to the care of matters so
curious, so well-deserving of a quiet hour.</p>

<p>‘We must talk at large of these somewhat serious
concerns, my lords. We must take our time, hasten so far
as we may, but with a temperate spur—ay, a temperate
spur. We must consult, discriminate those who stand our
friends from those who are unfriendly; from those who cry,
not without reason, for recognition. We must not omit
those who are afar off, nor those who will come about us
asking questions—what is to be lost, what gained? Many
considerations rise up on the instant, others will crowd
upon us. Where are my lords of Crawfurd and Atholl?
Are they behind you? I cannot see them. What says my
lord of Lindsay, that very steadfast Christian? Where,
alas, is my lord of Morton’s honour?’</p>

<p>‘Sir,’ cried Huntly, fuming, ‘we can resolve your many
questions when you have answered our one. We asked
you not, what says one or what says another? but, rather,
what says your lordship?’</p>

<p>Lord Moray smiled. ‘Ah, my Lord Chancellor, if your
lordship had not been so long a stranger to my poor house,
your question had hardly been put to me. Those who
know me best, my lord, do not need to confirm by vain
assurances my love of country, or desire to serve the throne
of my dear sister. Forgive me if I say that, with older
eyes than your lordship’s, I take a wider range. I see your
distresses—perhaps I see a remedy. Perhaps your proposal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
is one, perhaps it is a danger worse than the disease. It
may be——’</p>

<p>He threatened to become interminable, so Huntly, with
no patience at command, left him in the midst. With
disapproval in every prim line of his face Lord Moray
watched him go. He said nothing more; and why should
he say anything, when all was forwarding as he wished?
He did repeat to the Secretary, afterwards and in private,
that it was sore pity to have the Earl of Morton still in
exile—a saying which that worthy misapprehended.
But here the Councils stopped, though the Queen did not,
but pushed on to Berwick, and reached Edinburgh by mid-November.
At Craigmillar, where she chose to stay, they
were resumed under the more hopeful auspices of Lord
Bothwell, whom at last she summoned to her side out of
Liddesdale.</p>

<p>This is because jealousy, that canker in the green-wood,
was groping in her now, though not, even yet, of that
sordid kind which is concerned with its own wound. She
no longer wrote to Bothwell save on details of business,
because she conceived her letters distasteful to him; and
she would not have recalled him had not Lethington
assured her of the common need of his counsel. The sort
of jealousy she suffered filled her, rather, with a kind of noble
zeal to do him honour. Although she would not write to
him, she could never rest without news of his daily doings.
So when she heard that he and his Countess were reading
Petrarch together, many hurt lines, but no vulgar splenetic
lines, were committed to the casket.</p>

<p class="noindent">She wrote, and believed, that she grudged Lady Bothwell

</div>
</div>

<p>‘God pity this poor lady!’ Des-Essars bursts forth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
having been imparted these outrageous lines. ‘She who
could believe that my Lord Bothwell was without peer in
beauty, kindness, and constancy, might very well believe
that she herself was not jealous of his wife.’</p>

<p>Jealous or no, it was jealousy of a strange kind. When
her beloved answered his summons by attending her at
Craigmillar, she received him with a dewy gratefulness
which went near to touch him. ‘You have come, then!
Oh, but you are good to your friend,’—a speech which for
the moment bereft him of speech. She asked after the
Countess, spoke of her as her sister, pitied her sitting alone
at Hermitage, and inspired the gross-minded man with
enthusiasm for her exalted mood.</p>

<p>He threw himself into the plotting and whispering with
which the Court was rife, talked long hours with Lethington,
was civil to Moray and his ‘flock,’ as he called Argyll and
the rest. Nothing much came of it all. Moray went so
far as to suggest divorce. Lethington thought much of it,
and carried it to Bothwell, who thought nothing of it. He
declined to discuss it with her Majesty.</p>

<p>‘Take your proposal to her if you choose,’ he said; ‘lay
it before her. I know what she will say, and agree with
her beforehand. This is no way of doing for men, or for
crowned women.’</p>

<p>He had the rights of it. ‘What!’ she cried, ‘and make
my son a bastard! And he to be King of England! I
think they have had bastards enough on that throne. Your
plan is foolish.’</p>

<p>Lethington was upon his mettle. He was to be married
come Christmas, and, indebted for this prospect to the
Queen and Bothwell, was desirous to owe her as much
more as she would lend him. ‘Madam,’ he said, ‘I cannot
admit my plan to be so dangerous to the Prince’s highness;
but I will content you yet. Give me leave to devise yet
once more.’</p>

<p>‘Devise as you will, sir,’ said she, ‘but be quick, or I
shall begin with devices of my own. You know that a
foumart in a trap scruples not to use tooth and claw. And
he is wise, since soft glances are never likely to help him.’
Almost immediately she began to cry at the thought of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
herself in a trap, ‘to cry and torment herself,’ says the
annalist. And one night, at supper with a few of them,
she lashed out in a fury at her impotence. ‘Ah, it is too
much, what I suffer among you all! I have borne him a
son, and he would steal him from my breast. He would
tip that innocent tongue with poison that he may envenom
his mother. If I am not soon quit of this there is but one
end to it.’</p>

<p>Patience, they counselled. ‘Ay, madam,’ said foolish
old Livingstone, ‘patience, and shuffle the cards.’</p>

<p>‘Shuffle you yours, my lord,’ she said, looking lofty, ‘if
you think them worthy of Fortune’s second thoughts. For
me, I know a shorter way to end the game.’</p>

<p>In private, she and Bothwell were in full accord. She
was to obey him, and leave him alone. ‘No questions, my
soul!’ he was for ever saying to her, half jocularly, half
with meaning that she was to be blind, deaf, and dumb.
She shut her eyes and mouth and put her fingers to her
ears; and in time this became a habit. ‘My prince, my
master,’ she said once, and gave him both her hands, ‘I am
your servant, and submit to you in all things. Use me
well.’ He kissed her fondly as he swore that so he would.</p>

<p>It was after the King had visited her and gone again,
whither no one knew, that Lethington produced his second
plan. As before, he was careful to submit it to Bothwell.
What did his good lordship think of this? The King was
to meet her Majesty at Stirling for the Prince’s baptism;
he would be ill received by the ambassadors, and therefore
mutinous, probably with outcry. Let one then, with all
proofs in his hands, indict him of treason. Let him be
summoned to answer, and upon refusal, arrested. He
would certainly resist, with violence. The end was sure.
Now, what did his good lordship think?</p>

<p>His good lordship spoke his plain mind, as he always
did to Lethington, whom he scorned. ‘You don’t kill a
sheep with hounds and horn. Pray, my friend, where will
be my lord of Moray all this while? Will he wind the
horn? I do not remember that that is his way. Or will
he find occasions to be in his lands? Or turn his coat and
cry, God bless our King-Consort and the True Kirk?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span></p>

<p>Lethington had a late autumnal smile, with teeth showing
through like the first frost. ‘I will tell your lordship
what he will do. He will see and not see. He will look
on and not behold.’</p>

<p>‘You mean, I gather, that he will be at his prayers,
looking through his fingers while we foul ours?’</p>

<p>‘Your lordship is most precise.’</p>

<p>However, his plan went before the Queen, who gave it
a gloomy approval. ‘He is so clogged with treason, he
will never run. You will have an easy capture. Let
nothing be done till my son be christened.’</p>

<p>Immediately afterwards she was instructed by Bothwell
that the project was as vain as wind, because it depended
upon two unstable things. First, if he allowed himself to
be taken, what on earth was to be done with him? There
must be an assize. And to which side in that would
Moray lean?</p>

<p>She could not answer him.</p>

<p>‘No,’ said he, ‘you cannot; nor can any man in
Scotland.’</p>

<p>‘I am of your mind,’ she said—superfluous assurance!</p>

<p>‘Well, then,’ he went on, ‘let them stir their broth of
grouts. They are all greedy knaves together: perchance
one or another will tumble into the stew and we be quit
of him.’</p>

<p>‘But if we leave them,’ she hesitated, ‘they may attempt
to take him—and then——’</p>

<p>Bothwell laughed. ‘Nay, I will see to it that they do
not. Oh, madam, trust your honest lover, and all shall go
greatly for you and me.’</p>

<p>She threw herself into his arms. Trust him! O God,
had she not found a man at last?</p>

<p class="tb">When they all met at Stirling to christen the Prince,
the King was so ill received that, as Lethington had
expected, he refused to leave his lodging even for the
ceremony. He was literally alone, without his father,
without any Scots lord to his name; sitting for the most
part in a small room, drinking and playing cards. He
used to ride out at night so that he need not tempt the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
discourtesy of the wayfarers; and once, when the guard at
the gate hesitated about passing him in, he flew into a
tempest of rage, drew, and killed the man on the spot.
Lethington flew from lord to lord. What better opportunity
than this?</p>

<p>Everything was prepared, all the proofs gathered in.
There were letters of his to the Queen-Mother of France,
to his own mother, Lady Lennox, to the English Catholics,
to the Duke of Norfolk, to certain Jesuits in the West.
One Highgate brought intercepted papers—a chart of
Scilly, a plan of Scarborough Castle: and some other
fellow was fished up, a bladder full of whispers of a plot
to steal the Prince. Lastly, to crown the image of a perfect
traitor, there was a draft proclamation of himself as Regent
of Scotland. Enough here to hang a better man!</p>

<p>‘Well,’ said Huntly, when Lethington showed him the
whole budget, ‘take your measures, show me my place,
and meet me at your own time. I’ll not fail you.’</p>

<p>That night Lord Bothwell came into the Queen’s
chamber while she was at her prayers. She saw him, but
pretended that she did not, finished her rosary, and bowed
her head over it; then got up and kissed him before all
her circle. Very soon they were alone together.</p>

<p>‘I disturbed you,’ he said; ‘I regret it.’</p>

<p>‘Regret it not—it was sweet disturbance. My heart
flew faster than my beads.’</p>

<p>He took her hand up. ‘Why do you tell me such
things? Do you know what disorder they work in me?’</p>

<p>She pretended that she must disengage her hand, but
he would not allow it.</p>

<p>‘Alas, sir,’ she said, ‘we whip each other, you and I.
Each is a torment to the other. One runs, the other
chases,—but whither?’</p>

<p>‘Quick, quick to the goal!’</p>

<p>‘Take me thither in your arms, my Bothwell. Carry
me, lest I faint by the way.’</p>

<p>‘No fainting now. The hour is come, and I with it. I
have counsel for you.’</p>

<p>‘Counsel me—I will be faithful.’</p>

<p>‘I recommend, then, to your clemency the Earl of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
Morton, his kinsman Douglas of Whittinghame, and all
their factions.’</p>

<p>She pondered the saying, not discerning at first what it
purported, yet fearing to ask him lest he should be impatient
of her stupidity. No man had ever made her feel
stupid but this one.</p>

<p>‘Do you wish it?’ she asked him.</p>

<p>‘I advise it.’</p>

<p>‘They are no friends of yours?’</p>

<p>‘They may become so.’</p>

<p>‘And you remember that they greatly offended me?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, madam,’ he cried out irritably, ‘who has not
offended you in this wicked land? Did not your sour
brother offend you? Has not Lethington offended? Have
not Huntly and I? Believe me, this Morton has himself
been offended, and by the very man who has offended you
more vilely than any other. There was one who betrayed
you to the Douglases, but that same man betrayed the
Douglases to you. Therefore I say, if you wish to redeem
your honour, let Morton redeem his, and your affair is
done. You force me to speak plainly.’</p>

<p>She saw his meaning now, and her eyes grew blank
with fear. ‘Hush,’ she said, ‘speak no plainer. Those
two will kill him.’</p>

<p>He shrugged. ‘You speak plainer than I. In advising
you, however, to send open letters of pardon to Morton
and his cousin, I have but done my duty, as we had agreed
it should be. But it is for your Majesty to follow or to
leave, as you will. I am still the servant.’</p>

<p>She went slowly to him, took up his hands and put them
on her shoulders. He let her have the weight. ‘Now I
feel your strong hands, Bothwell.’</p>

<p>‘It is you that put them there.’</p>

<p>‘It is where they should be. Servants use not so their
hands, but only masters. And good servants soon grow
to love the yoke.’ Suddenly she dropped to his feet and
embraced his knees. ‘I am yours, I am yours! Do as
you will with me and all.’</p>

<p>Open letters were despatched to Lord Morton and Mr.
Archie Douglas, that, on certain terms, they and their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
factions might gain pardon and remission of forfeitures.
On the evening of the same day the King left Stirling
without any farewells and sped to Glasgow.</p>

<p>Lethington, completely fooled, ran open-mouthed to
Bothwell. ‘Here is a discomfiture, my lord! I am dumbfounded.
Just when we were sure of him.’</p>

<p>‘Maybe you were too sure. There will be a vent-hole
in your body politic.’</p>

<p>‘My lord, I can answer for the entirety of it. Tush, my
credit is gone! I am vexed to death.’</p>

<p>‘I see that it puts you out. But courage, man! you
will find a way yet.’</p>

<p>‘If I find one now, after this rebuff, it will be owing to
your lordship’s good opinion,’ said the guileless Lethington:
‘a sharp spur to me, I do assure you.’</p>

<p>Bothwell took him by the arm. ‘Do you feel so sure,’
he asked him, ‘that our man hath not had a fright?’</p>

<p>‘What fright? Not possible—or I am not up with
your lordship.’</p>

<p>Bothwell half-closed his eyes. ‘How do you suppose he
would look upon the return of Morton and the Douglases?’</p>

<p>Lethington started, then stared at the floor. ‘Ay,’ he
said—‘ay! I had not given that a thought. Man, Lord
Bothwell,’ he whispered, ‘yon’s his death-warrant, and he
knows it.’</p>

<p>Lord Bothwell clacked his tongue.</p>

<span class="smaller">SHE LOOKS BACK ONCE</span></h3>

<p>Just at this point in the story Des-Essars confesses to the
desire having been hot within him to assassinate the Earl
of Bothwell; and writing it down when the opportunity
had come and was gone, he may well say, ‘What would
have been the pain and loss of dear blood, had I done it,
in comparison to present anguish?’ He is, however, forced
to admit that he did not meditate so violent a deed for the
sake of avoiding future disaster, but rather to make the
present more tolerable. It was his lot to be much with
the Queen and her chosen lover; he owns that he found
the constant fret of their intercourse almost impossible to
be borne. ‘I declare before God and the angels,’ he says,
‘that her dreadful lavishing of herself during these weeks
of waste and desire caused my heart to bleed. She stripped
herself bare of every grace of mind, spirit, and person, and
strewed it in his way, heaping one upon another until he
seemed to be wading knee-deep in her charms. Nay, but
he wallowed in them like a brute-beast, unrecognising and
unthankful—a state of affairs unparalleled since Galahad
(who was a good knight) lay abed and was nourished upon
the blood of a king’s virgin daughter. How different this
knight from that, let these pages declare; and my mistress’s
high mind, how similar to that spending martyr’s. For
it is most certain that all her acts towards the Lord Bothwell
were moved by magnanimity. Stripping herself nobly,
she stood the more noble for her nakedness. She suffered
horribly: his the horrible sin. Love—in the great manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
of it—should be a conflict of generosity; either lover should
be emulous of pain and loss. But here she gave and this
accursed butcher took; she spent and he got.</p>

<p>‘I saw them together at their various houses of sojourn
during this winter: at Drymen in Perth, a house of my
Lord Drummond’s; at Tullibardine, at Callander, and
again in Edinburgh. Little joy had they of each other,
God wot! There are two kinds of lovers’ joys, as I think—the
mellow and the sharp. The one is rooted in the
heart and the other in the sense, but both alike need leisure
of mind if they are to bear fruit; for in the contemplation
of our happiness lies the greatest happiness of all. Now,
these two were never at rest; they could never look upon
each other and let the eyes dwell there with the thought,
<i>My Beloved is mine and I am his, and as it is now so it
shall be.</i> No, but they looked beyond each other through
a tangle of sin and error, searching until their eyeballs
ached if haply they might discover a gleam beyond of that
windless garden of the Hesperides wherein was put their
hope. Fond searching, fond hope! they could never win
the garden. Her desires were boundless, unappeasable,
and so were his; for she sought to be perfect slave and he
to be absolute master. And how was she to be his servant,
who was born a queen? and how he the master he sought
to be, when no empire the world ever saw would have contented
him? But the greatest bar of severance between
them was this: there was no community of interest possible
between them. For, to her, this Bothwell was the only
End; and to him this fair sweet Queen was only a Means.
This is a pregnant oracle of mine, worth your travail.
Perpend it, you who read.’</p>

<p>Des-Essars did not believe that Lord Bothwell loved
the Queen. He had been often at Hermitage, you must
remember, and seen the Earl and Countess together. My
lord was not regardful of bystanders when he chose to
fondle his handsome wife. When the two were separated,
as now they were, the observant young man was aware
that they wrote frequently to each other: French Paris
was for ever coming and going between Liddesdale and
his master’s lodging, wherever that might chance to be.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
He was certain, too, that the Queen knew it. ‘Paris used
to deliver to my lord his wife’s letters, and he read them in
the Queen’s very presence, with scarce a “By your leave,
ma’am”; and at such times I have seen her Majesty pace
about the garden in great misery, pull at the rowan berries
until she scattered them, pluck at the branches of trees and
send the dry leaves flying; and once—as I shall never
forget—she thrust her hand and bare arm into a thicket of
nettles, and when she drew it out it was all red to the
elbow, with sore white blotches upon it where the poison
had boiled the blood. Her arm went stiff afterwards, but
she never let him know the reason.’</p>

<p class="tb">After the christening, about Christmas-time, the Earl of
Morton and his friends came home to Scotland, were introduced
into the Queen’s presence by the Earls of Bothwell
and Huntly, and upon submission (and their knees) restored
to their former estates. She had nothing to say to them,
but sat like one entranced, looking fixedly at the floor
while Bothwell made his speech, and Morton after him, in
his bluff way, expressed his contrition and desire to be of
service in the future. Mr. Archie Douglas, one of a crowd
of repentant rebels, contented himself with cheering. ‘God
save your Majesty!’ was his cry, and ‘Confusion to all
your enemies!’ whereupon my Lord Morton bethought
him of the real occasion of his recall, and added to his
speech a few words more.</p>

<p>‘Oh, ay!’ he said: ‘by our fruits you shall judge us,
madam, whether we be gratefully replanted in this dear
soil or no. Try us, madam, upon whomsoever hath
aggrieved you, or endangered your throne, or the thrones
of them that are to follow you—try us, I say, and see
whether our appetites to serve you are not whetted by our
long absence.’</p>

<p>She had started and looked hastily at Bothwell,—evidently
she was frightened. Her lips moved for some
time before any sound came forth from them, but presently
she said that she should not fail to call for service in the
field when she required it. ‘But the realm is now at
peace,’ she added, ‘and I hope will remain so.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span></p>

<p>Morton said: ‘Amen to that. Yet be prepared, madam,
as the sailors are, when they lie becalmed upon a sea like
oil, but see a brown haze hang where sky and water meet.
And, madam, trust yourself to them that are weatherwise
in this country.’</p>

<p>She stammered. ‘I know not what you need fear for
me—I hardly understand. I am very well served—very well
advised—but I thank you for your friendly warning....’
She forced herself to speak, but could not make a coherent
sentence. Bothwell intervened, and presently took away
his new friends.</p>

<p>Lord Morton went to the Douglas house of Whittingehame,
a leafy place in Haddington, not far from the sea.
Thither in the first days of January repaired Bothwell and
Huntly, while the Queen stayed in Edinburgh, friendless,
except for Des-Essars and Mary Seton. She passed her
days like one in a dream, speaking seldom, kneeling at
altars but not praying, negligent of her surroundings,
sometimes of her person, only alert when a messenger
might be looked for with a letter. Often found in tears,
either she could not or she would not account for them.
One day she bade Des-Essars go with her letter-carriers to
Whittingehame. ‘What would you have me do there,
madam?’ he asked.</p>

<p>She played drearily with his sword-strap. ‘Do? What
do spies in general? See—judge for yourself—look
through my eyes if you can.’</p>

<p>He turned to go, and she caught at his arm. ‘Baptist,’
she said, ‘I am in the dark, and horribly afraid. Look
you, I know not what they are doing there together. They
whisper and wink and nod at each other; they say little
and mean much. I cannot divine what they intend—or
what they will presently ask me to do. I saw Archie
Douglas grin like a wolf that day he was here—I know not
what he grinned at. They tell me nothing—nothing! Do
not suppose but that I trust my lord; but, Baptist, find
out something. I need courage.’ She lay back exhausted,
and when he came to her waved him off, whispering that
he was to be quick and go.</p>

<p>He departed, reached Whittingehame within the day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
saw what he could—which was precisely nothing, for Lord
Bothwell was away and Lord Morton not visible—and on
his road home again heard that the King lay dangerously
ill at Glasgow, of smallpox or worse. He took that news
in his pocket, and none that he could have gleaned from
the whispers of Whittingehame could have had effect so
surprising. For the first time for many a month he saw
his Queen sane, sweet, crying woman. She fell on her
knees, hiding her face in his sleeve, and gave thanks to
God. When she rose up and went back to her chair he
saw the tears in her eyes. She asked him no further of
Bothwell and Morton at their secrets, or of Archie’s grins.
When he came and knelt before her she took his face in
her hands and kissed it. ‘God hath saved me, my dear,
and by you,’ she said. ‘He hath heard my prayers. I am
sure now that I shall find mercy. O fortunate messenger!
O happy soul, whom thou hast redeemed!’</p>

<p>‘Madam,’ he said eagerly, seeing now why she was
so thankful, ‘let me go to Glasgow. You cannot otherwise
be sure of this report. The King may be ill,
and yet not mortally. Let us be sure before we give
thanks.’</p>

<p>She was crying freely. ‘I have not deserved so great a
mercy, God knoweth. I have been near to deadly sin.
Yes, yes—go, Baptist. Go at once, and return with speed.’
It was settled that he should take with him her physician
and a message of excuse that business kept her from him.
He went to prepare himself; she to write to Bothwell a
brave and hopeful letter concerning this streak of blue in
her storm-packed sky. Before dark Des-Essars was away
on a fresh horse.</p>

<p class="tb">Up from Whittingehame in a day or two came Mr.
Secretary Lethington, very busy; and had private speech
with the Queen, reporting the councils of her friends down
there. She listened idly to his urgings of this and that.
What interest had she now in plots woven under yew trees
or in panelled chambers, when high Heaven itself had
declared for her quarrel? Did Archie grin like a wolf,
Morton flush and handle his dagger? Let them—let them!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
An angel with a flaming sword stood on the house-roof at
Glasgow, and their little rages were nought.</p>

<p>At the end of his circuitous oration—‘Well, have you
ended?’ she asked him.</p>

<p>‘Madam, I have no more to say.’</p>

<p>She took a scrap of paper and scribbled on it with a
pen. ‘Read that, if you please, and take it with you back
again.’</p>

<p>‘<i>Show to the Earl of Morton</i>,’ he read, ‘<i>that the Queen
will hear no speech of the matter arranged with him</i>.’</p>

<p>Bothwell laughed to see the dropped jaws, aghast at
this rebuff. But she, confident in the help of high Heaven—which
had plucked her, as she said, from the brink of
the pit—had recovered all her audacity. And so she waited,
almost happy again, for the return of her messenger.</p>

<p class="tb">Des-Essars was gone for more than a week; it was not
until the ninth day from his departure that he brought
back his report. I know not what she had expected—some
miraculous dealing or another by which God was
to signify that she was set free to follow her desires;
but whatever it was, the young Brabanter could not end
her suspense. So far as the doctors could judge, the
King’s illness might be sweated out of him: they were
trying that when he left. The fever must run its course;
no one could say that it must needs end fatally. Her
Majesty was to hope, said the doctors; and so said Des-Essars,
giving the word a twist round. To hope! She
was worn thin with hoping.</p>

<p>The King was horrible, he told her, and wore a taffeta
mask. He was peevish, but not furious; had not enough
strength left him for that. He lay and snapped at all who
came near him, harmlessly, like a snake robbed of its fang.
The light hurt his eyes, so he lay in the dark; but, being
extremely curious about himself, he had a candle burning
constantly beside him, and a hand-glass on the bed, in
which he was always looking at his face: a sign of morbid
affection of the brain, the doctors considered. The Queen
said carelessly, ‘Why, what else hath he ever cared for in
life but his own person?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span></p>

<p>She asked what he had replied to her message of excuse.
Des-Essars, who had not been allowed to talk with him,
and had only seen what he did see when the sick man
slept, had delivered it by Standen. Through Standen
also came the answer. The King’s words were, ‘This
much you shall say to the Queen: that I wish Stirling
were Jedburgh, and Glasgow the Hermitage, and I the
Earl of Bothwell as I lie here; and then I doubt not but
she would be quickly with me undesired.’</p>

<p>She flushed, but not with shame. ‘Doth he think me
at Stirling? He is out there; but otherwise, my dear, he
is right enough.’ She turned away with a sigh. ‘Well,
what can I do but wait?’ She was not allowed to wait
long.</p>

<p>Bothwell came to see her, and stayed till near midnight
in secret talk. It was wild and snowy, much like that
night, as Des-Essars remembered, in which Davy had been
slain, near a year ago; one of those nights when the mind,
unhappy and querulous, calls up every nerve to the extreme
point of tension. The young man, apprehensive of
any and every evil, kept the watch. He heard the door
shut, Bothwell’s step in the corridor; he flew to the antechamber,
hoping that she might send for him. But
though he waited there an hour or more in miserable
suspense, neither daring to show himself nor to leave the
place, he heard nothing. Between two and three o’clock in
the morning he fell asleep over the table, wrapped in his
cloak. As once before, she came in, a candle in her hand,
and awoke him by touching his head.</p>

<p>He sprang up, broad awake in an instant; he saw her.
‘Oh, your face!’ he cried out. ‘Haunted! haunted!’
It was a face all grey, and as still as marble save for the
looming eyes.</p>

<p>‘You sleep,’ she said, ‘but I keep vigil. Bid me good-bye.
I am going away.’</p>

<p>He said, ‘Where you go, I go. I dare not leave you as
now you are.’</p>

<p>She was in a stare. ‘I am going to the King.’</p>

<p>‘To the King!’ It horrified him. ‘You—alone?’</p>

<p>‘I am sent: I must go.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I go with you.’</p>

<p>She shook her head. ‘You cannot. What I do I
must do myself. Now bid me good speed upon my
journey.’</p>

<p>He folded his arms. ‘I think I will not. I think the
best wish I could make for you would be that you should
die.’</p>

<p>This she did not deny; but said she: ‘Vain wishing! I
know that I shall not die until my lord has made me his.
After that it had better be soon.’</p>

<p>He asked her, with trembling voice, what she wanted
with the King; for he verily thought that she was going
there for one dreadful purpose. She avoided the question.
The King had been asking for her, she said, and it was her
duty to obey him. ‘He is mending fast, they tell me;
and with his health his strength will return. I had rather’—she
said it with a sick shudder—‘I had rather see him
before he is able to move.’</p>

<p>‘Madam,’ urged the young man, much agitated, ‘I
entreat you, for the love of Christ! You must not touch
him, or allow.... He is one sore—hideous—poisoned
through and through. On my knees I beg of you. Nay,
before you go you shall kill me.’</p>

<p>She looked beside and beyond him in her set, pinched
way; he saw the doom written plain on her face. In an
agony, not knowing what he did, he confronted her boldly.
‘I shall prevent you. You shall not go.’</p>

<p>She said, looking at him now with softened eyes: ‘Oh,
if it were possible even now that I might be as once I was,
even now I would say to thee, my friend, Take me, O true
heart, for I would be true like thee! Ah, if it were possible!
Ah, if it were possible!’ Her great eyes seemed
homes of mournful light; so longingly did she look that,
for a moment, he thought he had conquered her. She
gave a shake of the head, and when she looked at him
again the kindly hue had gone. ‘But it is not possible—and
I am a soiled woman, wounded in the side and defiled
by my own blood; for my desire is not as thine.’</p>

<p>‘Oh,’ cried he, ‘what are you saying? Do you condemn
yourself?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span></p>

<p>She shook her head. ‘I neither condemn nor condone:
I speak the truth. I ache for my lover; I must
work my fingers to the bone for him.’</p>

<p>‘Not while I have mine—to work for you—to sin for
you.’</p>

<p>‘You cannot. Your fingers are too tender.’</p>

<p>This angered him. ‘How can you say that, madam?
How can you hurt me so? You know that I love you.
Is it nothing to you? Less than nothing?’</p>

<p>She said, ‘It is much. Come, you and I will kiss
together for the last time.’ She smiled a welcome, held
out her arms; sobbing, he put them down and took her
in his own instead, and held her close. There for a while
she was content to be. But when he began to take more
than his due, she gently disengaged herself, having won
her object, which was to depart without him. ‘Adieu, dear
faithful friend,’ she said—‘pray for me’; and as he knelt
before her, she stooped down and lifted up his head by
the chin, and kissed him on the forehead, and was gone.
After that, she was inaccessible to him, her door denied.</p>

<p>In three days’ time—on the 23rd of January—she
started for Glasgow with Lords Livingstone, Herries, and
Traquair. Bothwell went part of her way, to where the
roads divide. Her last public act had been to allow of the
marriage between Fleming and Lethington. ‘And now,’
she said, ‘I shall have but one Mary left, who came hither
with four. So endeth our Maids’ Adventure.’ But if I
am right, it had ended long before. Now she was but a
beast driven by the herdsmen to the market, there to be
cheapened by the butcher.</p>

<p class="tb">Of his own moving adventure of the night when, for
one moment, she assuredly looked back over her shoulder,
Des-Essars writes what I consider his most fatuous page.
‘There was,’ he says, ‘a kind of very passion in that close
embrace; and I knew, <i>by the way she returned my kisses</i>,
that she was strongly inclined to me. Indeed, she said as
much when she told me that it would have been possible,
at an earlier day, for her to love me as she had once loved
the King; with ardour, namely, like a fanciful child, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
secret mind, with the body but little concerned in the
matter.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> But it was too late. She owned herself tainted;
he had taught her vice. She could be child no more, girl
in love no more; alas, no, but a thirsty nymph stung by
an evil spirit, ever restless, ever craving, never to be
appeased....’</p>

<p>There is more in the same strain, which I say is
fatuous. Whether she had a tenderness for him or not—and
no doubt she had one—she was not revealing it then.
Far from it, she wanted to escape, and this was her readiest
way. She was at her old cajolery when she let him
embrace and kiss her; and maybe she did kiss back. It
is to be observed that she got her way immediately
afterwards.</p>

<span class="smaller">MEDEA IN THE BEDCHAMBER</span></h3>

<p>Women, in the experience of French Paris, as he once
informed a select company of his acquaintance, could only
be trusted to do a thing, and never to cause a thing to be
done. ‘They will always find a thousand reasons why it
should not be done, or why it should be done another way—their
way, an older way, a newer way, any way in the
world but yours. Burn the boats, burn the boats, dear sirs,
when you need a woman to help you, as you constantly do
in delicate affairs.’ He instanced, as a case in point, his
own confidence in Queen Mary, and his master’s want of
confidence, when the pair of them rode with her part of her
way to Glasgow; and how he was entirely justified by her
subsequent behaviour. It made little difference in the end,
to be sure; but no doubt she would have been saved a good
deal of distress if Bothwell had been as instructed as his
lacquey. As it is, it is to be feared that he fretted her
sadly. It was not only heartless to play upon her jealousy,
to put her so sharply upon her honour, but it was bad
policy on his part; for if the creature of your use starts
a-quivering at the touch of your hand, how are you served
if by your whip and spurs you set her plunging madly into
the dark, shying and swerving and cracking her heart?
You wear out your tool before the time. That is just
what Bothwell did.</p>

<p>The fact is that, as aforesaid, she was too sensitive an
instrument for his coarse fingers. As well give Blind Jack
a fiddle of Cremona for his tap-room jiggeries. If my lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
wanted work from her which Moll Bawd or Kate Cutsheet
would have done better, he should have known wiselier how
to get it than by using the only stimulus such hacks could
feel. This tremulous, starting, docile creature to be pricked
on by jealousy, forsooth! Why, that had been King
Darnley’s silly way. ‘I would that Glasgow might be the
Hermitage and myself the Earl of Bothwell as I lie here,’ he
had said; and it made her laugh and admit the truth. But
this Bothwell was no finer. ‘Ohè! a many weary leagues
before I win my home! Well, I am sure of a welcome
there.’ And then, when she bent her head to the way,
‘Ay, Queens and Kings, and all gudemen and wives are in
the like case. Bed and board—it comes down e’en to that.
Love is just a flaunty scarf to draw the eye with. You see
it purfling at a window, and, think you, that should be a
dainty white hand a-working there!’</p>

<p>She lifted her face to meet the driving snow, looked
into the dun sky and saw it speckled with black—her own
colours henceforward! Thus would she be from her soul
outwards—sodden grey, and speckled with black. The
burden of her heart was so heavy that she groaned aloud.
‘You falter, you fear!’ cried that fidgety brute. ‘Mercy,
mercy,’ she stammered; ‘I shall fail if you speak to me.’</p>

<p>The snow was falling fast, but there was no wind, when
she said farewell to her lover at Callander gate. He would
not go in; purposed to ride southward into Liddesdale
with but one change of horses, fearing that the wind would
get up after dark and make the hill-roads impossible. The
Black Laird of Ormiston, Tala, and Bowton were to go
with him; he left Paris behind to be her messenger if she
should need to send one. There was no time to spare.
‘Set on, gentlemen,’ he said, ‘I will overtake you.’</p>

<p>He shook the snow from his cloak, set it flying from
eyelashes and beard, drew near to the sombre lady where
she stood in the midst of her little company, and put his
hand upon her saddle-bow. ‘God speed your Grace upon
your goodly errand,’ he said—whereat she gave a little
moan of the voice, but did not otherwise respond—‘and
send us soon a happy meeting—Amen!’</p>

<p>She looked at him piercingly for a second of time, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
then resumed her staring and glooming. He cried her
farewell once more, saluted the lords, and pounded over
the frozen marsh. One could hear him talking and laughing
for a long way, and the barking answers of Ormiston.</p>

<p>The Queen rode up the avenue to the doors, and was
taken to bed by Mary Seton and Carwood. She kept her
chamber all that evening and night, but sent for Paris
early in the morning. He saw her in bed, thin and drawn
in the face, very narrow-eyed, and with a short cough. She
handed him a great sack, sealed and tied, and a letter.</p>

<p>‘Take these to your master at the Hermitage. You
shall have what horses you need. In that pack are four
hundred crowns. You see how much trust I have in you.’</p>

<p>Paris assured her that her trust was well bestowed, as
she should find out by his quick return to her.</p>

<p>She laughed, not happily. ‘I hope so. I came from
France, and to France I go in my need.’</p>

<p>‘Why, madam,’ says Paris, ‘does your Majesty intend
for my country?’</p>

<p>‘No, no. I shall see the land of France no more. I
spoke of Frenchmen, who are tender towards women.’</p>

<p>Paris felt inspired to say that none loved her Majesty
more entirely than the men of his nation, who had delicate
sensibility for the perfections of ladies. And he modestly
adduced as another example Monsieur Des-Essars, lately
advanced to be one of her esquires.</p>

<p>She coloured faintly. ‘Yes,’ she said, ‘I believe he loves
me well. Him also I trust—you, Paris, and Monsieur
Des-Essars.’</p>

<p>Paris fell upon his knees. She changed her mood
instantly, bade him begone with the treasure, and rejoin
her at Glasgow with letters from my lord.</p>

<p>Paris faithfully performed his errand, in spite of the
snow with which the country was blanketed as deeply as in
a fleece.</p>

<p>‘My lord was glad of the money,’ he tells us, ‘and sent
Monsieur de Tala away with it immediately. Before I left
him to go to the Queen at Glasgow he told me of his plot,
which was to blow the King up with gunpowder as he lay
in a lodging at Edinburgh. I said, the King was not at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
Edinburgh yet. “No, fool,” says he, “but he soon will be.”
He showed me papers of association whereon I was to
believe stood the names of my lord himself, of my Lords
Morton, Argyll, Huntly, Ruthven, and Lindsay, of Mr.
Douglas, Mr. James Balfour, and others. He pointed to
one name far below the others. “That,” he said, “is of
our friend the White Rat,”—my own name for Mr. Secretary.
He asked me what I thought of it; I told him, I thought
no good of it. “Why not, you fool?” he jeered at me.
I replied, “Because, my lord, you do not show me the
name of names.”</p>

<p>‘Although he knew entirely well what name I meant,
he forced me to mention Monsieur de Moray, and then was
angry that I did so. He said that lord would not meddle.
I said, “He is wise.” Then he began to jump about the
chamber, hopping from board to board like a crow with his
wing cut. “My lord of Moray! My lord of Moray!”
cried he out. “He will neither help nor hinder; but it is
all one. It is late now to change advice—as why should
we change for a fool’s word such as thine? If we have
Lethington, blockhead, have we not his master?”</p>

<p>‘I said, No; for those gentlemen who interested themselves
in the late David had Mr. Secretary, and thought
they had the Earl of Moray also. But they found out their
mistake the next day, when he came back and, rounding
upon them, turned every one of them out.</p>

<p>‘“Well,” he cried—“Well! What then? What is all
that to the purpose? Did he not sign my bond at the
Council of October?” That bond was what we used to
call “Of the Scotchmen’s Business,” because all present
signed a paper in favour of the Queen, which was not read
aloud. I admitted that he had signed it; but I was not
convinced by that. I considered that it pledged him to
nothing. I thought it my duty to add, “You are my
master, my lord. If you command me in this I shall serve
you, because in my opinion it is the business of servants to
obey, not to advise. But I say, for the last time, Beware
the Earl of Moray.” My master began to rail and swear
at his lordship—a natural but vain thing to do. I was
silent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span></p>

<p>‘The next day after, he told me that he had revealed his
plan to Monsieur Hob of Ormiston and to his brother-in-law,
my lord of Huntly. If I had dared I should have
asked him whether my lady the Countess had been informed;
and I did ask it of her woman Torles, who was a
friend of mine. But Torles said that, so far as she knew,
the Countess never spoke with my lord about the Queen’s
affairs.</p>

<p>‘I was curious about another thing, exceedingly curious.
“Tell me, my dear Torles,” I said, “our lord and lady—are
they still good friends?” From the way that she looked
at me, her sly way, and grinned, I knew the answer.
“They are better friends, my fine man, than you and I are
ever likely to be.” I said something gallant, to the effect
that there might be better reasons, and played some little
foolishness or other, which pleased her very much. Next
morning I started to go to Glasgow with letters for the
Queen’s Majesty.’</p>

<p>That was on the 26th January, the very day when Mr.
Secretary Lethington was married to his Fleming. Paris
heard that he took her to his house of Lethington, but (as
he truly adds) the affair is of no moment, where he took
her, or whether he took her at all. ‘It was long since she
had been of the Queen’s party; indeed, I always understood
that it was a love-match between them, entered into
at first sight; and that Mistress Fleming had been alienated
from her allegiance from the beginning.’ Paris was sorry.
‘She was a pretty and a modest lady, in a Court where
those two graces were seldom in partnership.’</p>

<p class="tb">He learned at Glasgow that the King was still very sick,
and the Queen in a low condition of body. It seems that
when she had reached the house she would not have the
patient informed of the fact, and would not go to him that
same night. Some of the Hamiltons had met her on the
road, and returned with her into the town. There was a
full house, quite a Court, and a great company about her
at supper. Lady Reres was there, an old friend of her
Majesty’s, and of Lord Bothwell’s too, and Lord Livingstone,
full of his pranks. He, it seems, had rallied the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
Queen finely about her despondency and long silences;
said in a loud whisper that he was ready for a toast to an
absentee if she would promise to drink to the name he
would cry; and although she would not do it, but shook
her head and looked away, his broad tongue was always
hovering about Bothwell’s name. It is to be supposed that
he drank to many distant friends, for Bastien, the Queen’s
valet, told Paris that his lordship grew very blithe after
supper. ‘If you will believe me, Paris,’ he said, ‘as her
Majesty was warming her foot at the fire, leaning upon this
Monsieur de Livingstone’s shoulder, his jolly lordship took
her round the middle as if she had been his wench, and
cried out upon her doleful visage. “Be merry,” says he,
“and leave the dumps to him you have left behind you.”
She flung away from him as if he teased her, but allowed
his arm to be where it was, and his hardy hand too.’</p>

<p>Great dealings for the Parises and Bastiens to snigger at.
I suppose it is no wonder that they unqueened her, since,
however fast they went to work, it was never so fast as she
did it to herself. They tell me it was always the way with
her family, to choose rather to be easy in low company than
stiff with the great folk about them. The common sort,
therefore, loved the race of Stuart, and the lords detested
it. But we must follow Paris if we are to see the Queen.</p>

<p>Though he delivered his letters as soon as he arrived,
he was not sent for until late at night. The King’s man,
Joachim, took him upstairs, saying as they went, ‘I hope
thou hast a stout stomach; for take it from me, all is not
very savoury up here.’</p>

<p>Paris replied that he had been so long in the service of
gentlemen that their savour meant little to him, even that
of diseased gentlemen.</p>

<p>‘Right,’ says Joachim; ‘right for thee, my little game-cock.
But thou shalt not find the Queen in too merry pin,
be assured.’</p>

<p>Carwood, her finger to her lip, met him in the corridor,
passed him in through the anteroom, and pulled aside the
heavy curtain. ‘Go in softly,’ she said, ‘and be careful
of your feet. It is very dark, and the King sleeps. In
with you.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span></p>

<p>She drew back and let the curtain drive him forward.
Certainly it was plaguey dark. He saw the Queen at the
far end of the chamber writing a letter, haloed in the light
of a single taper. She looked up when she heard him, but
did not beckon him nearer; so he stayed where he was,
and, as his eyes grew used to the gloom, looked about him.</p>

<p>It was a spacious room, but low in the ceiling, and
raftered, with heavy curtains across the windows, which
were embayed. A great bed was in the midst of the wall,
canopied and crowned, with plumes at the corners and
hangings on all sides but one—the door side. He could
not see the King lying there, though he could hear his
short breaths, ‘like a dog’s with its tongue out’; but
presently, to his huge discomfort, he made out a sitting
figure close to the pillow on the farther side, and not six
paces from him across the bed—man or woman he never
knew. It might have been a dead person, he said, for all
the motion that it made. ‘It sat deep in the shadow,
hooded, so that you could not see its face, or whether it
had a face; and one white hand supported the hood. It
did not stir when the sufferer needed assistance, such as
water, or the turning of a pillow, or a handkerchief. It was
a silent witness of everything done and to be gone through
with; gave me lead in the bowels, as they say, the horrors
in the hair.’</p>

<p>It may have been Mary Seton, or a priest, or a watching
nun; at any rate, it terrified Paris, his head already weakened
by the burden of that fetid chamber. The air was
overpowering, tainted to sourness, seeming to clog the
eyelids and stifle the light.</p>

<p>By and by the Queen beckoned him forward, putting
up her finger to enjoin a soft tread. He came on like a
cat, and stood within touching distance of her, and saw
that she was kneeling at a table, writing with extreme
rapidity, tears running down her face. There was a silver
crucifix in front of her, to which she turned her eyes from
time to time, as if referring to it the words which cost her
so much to put down. Once, after a frenzy of penmanship,
she held out her hands to it in protest; then reverently
took it up and kissed it, to sanctify so the words she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
was writing: ‘The good year send us that God knit us
together for ever for the most faithful couple that ever He
did knit together.’ Paris knew very well to whom she
wrote so fully, who was to read this stained, passionate
letter, ill scrawled on scraps of old paper, scored with
guilt, blotted with shameful tears, loving, repentant, wilful,
petulant, unspeakably loyal and tender, all by turns. At
this moment the King called to her.</p>

<p>He lay, you must know, with a handkerchief over his
face. Paris had believed him asleep, for his breathing,
though short, was regular, and his moaning and the working
of his tongue counted for little in a sick man’s slumber.
But while she was in the thick of her work at the table he
coughed and called out to her in distress, ‘Mary, O Mary!
where are you gone?’ And when she did not answer, but
went on with the unspinning of the thought in her mind,
and let him call ‘Mary, O Mary!’ Paris, looking from one
to the other—and awfully on that shrouded third—found
blame for her in his heart.</p>

<p>She finished her line, got up, and went to the foot of
the bed. ‘You call me? What is your pleasure?’</p>

<p>‘His pleasure! Faith of a Christian!’ thinks Paris.</p>

<p>The King whispered, ‘Water, in Christ’s name’; and
Paris heard the clicking of his dry tongue. Nevertheless
he said, ‘Let me fetch you the water, madam.’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ she said, ‘fetch it you. And I would that one of
us could be drowned in the water.’</p>

<p>He poured some into a cup and took it to her.</p>

<p>‘Give it him,’ says she, ‘give it him. I dare not go
nearer.’</p>

<p>The King heard that, and became sadly agitated. He
wriggled his legs, tossed about, and began to wail feebly.
In the end she had to take it, but you could see that she
was nearly sick with loathing of him, natural and otherwise.
For to say nothing that she had to lift the handkerchief,
that he was hideous, his breath like poison, she was
so made that only one could possess her at a time. If
she loved a man she could not abide that any other should
claim a right of her—least of all one who had a title to
claim it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span></p>

<p>The water cooled his fever for a time and brought him
vitality. He talked, babbled, in the random way of the
very sick, plunging headlong into the heart of a trouble
and flying out before one can help with a hand. But he
was quick enough to see that she did not respond readily,
and sly enough to try her upon themes which he judged
would be stimulating. He confessed with facile tears the
faults of his youth and temper, begged her pardon times
and again for his offences against her. ‘Oh, I have done
wickedly by you, my love, but all’s over now. You shall
see how well we will do together.’</p>

<p>Said she, ‘It will be better to wait a while. Talk not
too much, lest you tax yourself.’</p>

<p>He rolled about, blinking his sightless eyes. ‘Do not
be hard upon me! I repent—I tell you that I do. Pardon
me, my Mary, pardon my faults. Let us be as we were
once—lovers—wedded lovers—all in all!’ Paris saw
her sway, with shut eyes, as she listened to him. ‘I would
have you sleep now, my lord. It will be best for you.
You tire yourself by talking.’</p>

<p>He begged for a kiss, and, when she affected not to
hear him, grew very wild. It was a curious thing that she
did then, watched by Paris with wonder. She dipped the
tips of her two forefingers in the cup of water, and, putting
them together, touched the back of his hand with them.
‘Ah, the balm of your cool sweet lips!’ he cried out, and
was satisfied. But when he asked her to kiss his forehead
she, in turn, became agitated, laughing and crying at once,
and rocked herself about before she could repeat the touch
of her two wet fingers on so foul a place. Again he
sighed his content, and lay quiet, and presently dozed
again.</p>

<p>She left him instantly and went back to her writing.
She wrote fast; the fierce pen screamed over the paper:
‘You make me dissemble so much that I am afraid
thereof with horror.... You almost make me play the
part of a traitor.... If it were not for obeying I had rather
be dead. My heart bleedeth at it....’ And again,
‘Alas! I never deceived anybody, but I remit myself
wholly to your will. Send me word what I shall do, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
whatsoever happen unto me I will obey you.... Think
also if you will not find some invention more secret by
physic; for he is to take physic at Craigmillar and the
baths also, and shall not come forth for a long time....</p>

<p>... ‘It is very late; and although I should never be
tired in writing to you, yet I will end after kissing your
hands. Excuse my evil writing and read this over twice....
Pray remember your friend and write to her, and
often. Love me always as I shall love you.’</p>

<p>She put a bracelet of twisted hair in between the sheets,
made a packet of the whole, and beckoned Paris to follow
her into the next room. ‘Take you this,’ she said, ‘whither
you know well, and tell my lord all that you have seen
and heard. He will learn so that I am a faithful and
obedient lover. And if he should be jealous, and ask you
in what manner I have behaved myself here, you may
show him.’ So speaking, she joined her two forefingers, as
he had seen her do before, and touched the table with
them. He was not likely to forget that, however. It
struck him as an ingenious and quaint device.</p>

<p>‘If my lord need me,’ she went on, ‘he can send you to
Linlithgow, where I shall lie one night. Thence I shall go
directly to Craigmillar with the King’s litter. It is late,
and I must go to bed, if not to sleep. Other women lie
abed, comforted, or to be comforted before daylight; but
that cannot I be as yet. Now go, Paris.’</p>

<p>He said, ‘Madam, be of good heart. All things come
by waiting.’</p>

<p>She sighed, but said nothing. He made his reverence,
and away.</p>

<h3 id="III_CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="smaller">KIRK O’ FIELD</span></h3>

<p>The Earl of Bothwell returned to Edinburgh the day
before the Queen was to leave Glasgow, and sent for Des-Essars
to come to his lodging. ‘Baptist,’ he said, ‘I
understand that her Majesty will be at Linlithgow this
night, with the King in his litter. She will look to see me
there, but I cannot go, with all my affairs in this town
out of train and no one to overlook them but myself. I
desire you, therefore, to go with the escort that is to meet
her, and to give her this message from me: “It has not
been found possible to accommodate the King at Craigmillar,
but a house has been got for him near Saint-Mary-in-the-Field,
and properly furnished. Please your Majesty,
therefore, direct his bearers thither.”’</p>

<p>He made him repeat the words two or three times until
he was sure of them; then added, ‘If the Queen ask you
more concerning this house, <i>with intent to know more</i>, and
not for mere curiosity, you shall tell her that it is near the
great house of the Hamiltons, in the which the Archbishop
now lodges. She will be satisfied with that, you will find,
and ask you no more.’</p>

<p>Des-Essars understood him perfectly; but in case the
reader do not, I shall remind him that this Archbishop
Hamilton of Saint Andrews was brother of the old Duke
of Châtelherault, of whom he used to hear in the beginning
of this book—one of the clan, then, which disputed the
Succession with the Lennox Stuarts and was regarded by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
the King as an hereditary enemy, with a blood-feud neither
quenched nor quenchable. That same Archbishop, when
the Queen was at Stirling for the baptism, scaring of the
King, recall of Morton and the rest of the deeds done there,
had been restored to his consistorial powers, and put at
liberty to bind and loose according to his discretion and
that of Saint Peter his master. There had been some talk
at the time as to why he had been so highly favoured,
and the opinion commonly held that he was to divorce
the Queen from the King. That was not French Paris’s
opinion, for one. In Edinburgh now, at any rate, was this
Archbishop Hamilton with the keys of binding and loosing
in his hands, not as yet making any use of them, and
lodging in the great family house without the city wall.</p>

<p>Well, the escort departed for Linlithgow, Des-Essars
with it. This is what he says of his adored mistress:</p>

<p>‘I think she was glad to see me, as certainly was I to
see her looking so hale and fresh. Her eyes were like wet
stars; she kissed me twice at meeting, with lips which had
regained their vivid scarlet, were cool but not dry. I
hastened to excuse my Lord Bothwell on the score of
affairs. “Yes, yes, I know how pressed he is,” she replied.
“I know he would have come if it had been possible. He
has sent me the best proxy by you.” I told her that my
Lord Huntly would be here momently, but she made a
pouting mouth and a little grimace—then looked slily at
me and laughed.</p>

<p>‘I rehearsed faithfully my Lord Bothwell’s message, and
could not see that she was particularly interested in the
King’s actual lodging—though that is by no means to
imply that she was <i>not</i> interested. It is due to say that I
never knew any person in all my experience of Courts and
policy so quick as she not only to conceal her thoughts,
but also to foresee when it would behove her to conceal
them. It was next to impossible to surprise her heart out
of her.</p>

<p>‘She asked me eagerly for Edinburgh news. I told her
that the Hamiltons were in their own house; the Archbishop
there already, and my Lord of Arbroath expected
every day. She said in a simple, wondering kind of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
way, “Why, the Hamilton house is next neighbour unto
the King’s, I suppose?”</p>

<p>‘“Madam,” I said, “it is. And so my Lord Bothwell
bid me remind your Majesty.”</p>

<p>‘She laughed; a little confusedly. “Better the King
should not know of it,” she said. “He hates that family,
and fears them, too. But that is not extraordinary, for he
always hates those whom he fears.”</p>

<p>‘She asked, was my lord of Morton in town? I
replied that he was, with a strong guard about his doors
and a goodly company within them, as Mr. Archibald
Douglas of Whittingehame and his brother, Captain
Cullen, Mr. Balfour of Fliske, and others like him, and
also the laird of Grange. To him resorted most of the
lords of the new religion; they, namely, of Lindsay, Ruthven,
Glencairn, and Argyll. My lord of Bothwell, however,
lodging in the Huntly house, had a larger following
than the Douglases; for all the Hamiltons paid him
court as well as his own friends. She did not ask me, but
I told her that her brother, my Lord Moray, kept much to
himself, and saw few but ministers of his religion, such as
Mr. Wood and Mr. Craig, and Mr. Secretary Lethington,
who (with his wife) was lodged in his lordship’s house, and
worked with him every day.</p>

<p>‘She stopped me here by looking long at me, and then
asking shortly, “Have you heard anything of my Lady
Bothwell?” which confused me very much. I could only
reply that I had heard she had been indisposed. “I am
sorry to hear it,” said she in quite an ordinary tone, “and
am sorry also for her, when she finds out that her sickness
is not what she hopes it is. You have not seen her, I
suppose?” I had not.</p>

<p>‘“I have seen her in illness,” she pursued. “It does not
become white-faced women to be so, for to be pale is one
thing, but to be pallid another. When the transparency
departs from a complexion of ivory, the residuum is paste.
I myself have not a high colour by nature: yet when I am
ill, as I am now, I always have fever, and look better than
when my health is better. Did you not think, when you
saw me first this morning, that I looked well?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I had thought she looked both beautiful and well, and
told her so. She was pleased.</p>

<p>‘“I love you, Baptist, when you look at me like that,
and your words find echo in your eyes. Now I will tell
you that the joy of seeing you again had much to say to
my good looks. But I think that women would always
rather look well than be well.”</p>

<p>‘As soon as my Lord Huntly had come in and dined,
we departed from Linlithgow. Her Majesty rode on with
that lord, Lord Livingstone and the others, leaving me
behind with Mr. Erskine and the ladies, to conduct the
King’s litter safely to the house prepared for him. I did
not see his face nor hear him speak, but understood that
he was greatly better. His hand, which was often outside
the curtains, waving about, looked that of a clean man.
He kept it out there, my Lady Reres told me, in the hope
that her Majesty would see and touch it. Once, when it
had been signalling about for some while, her ladyship
said, “’Tis a black shame there should be a man’s hand
wagging and no woman’s to slip into it.” So then she let
him get hold of hers; and he, thinking he had the Queen’s,
squeezed and fondled it until she was tired. We got him
by nightfall into a mean little house, set in a garden the
most disconsolate and weed-grown that ever you saw. It
was a wild, wet evening, and as we went down Thieves’
Row the deplorable inhabitants of that street of stews and
wicked dens were at their doors watching us. As we came
by they pointed to the gable of the house, and uttered harsh
and jeering cries. Lady Reres screamed and covered her
face. There was perched an old raven on the gable-end,
that croaked like any philosopher in the dumps; and as
we set down the litter in the roadway, he flapped his
ragged wings twice or thrice, and flew off into the dark,
trailing his legs behind him. The people thought it an
ill-omen....’</p>

<p class="tb">Here, for the time being, I forsake Des-Essars, and that
for two reasons: the first, that I have a man to hand who
knew more; the second, that what little the Brabanter did
know he did not care to tell. A more than common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
acquaintance with his work assures me that his secret preoccupied
him from hereabouts to the end—that <i>Secret des
Secrets</i> of his which he thought so important as to have
written his book for nothing else but to hold it. We shall
come upon it all in good time, and see more evidently than
now we do another, and what we may call supererogatory
secret, which is that he grew bolder in his passion for the
Queen, and she, perhaps, a little inclined to humour it. But
for the present we leave him, and turn to the brisk narrative
of one who knew nearly everything that was to be known,
and could hazard a sharp guess at things which, it almost
seems, could never perfectly be known. I mean, of course,
our assured friend French Paris—bought, once for all,
with a crown piece.</p>

<p>French Paris asks, in his bright way, ‘Do you know
that lane that runs straight from the Cowgate to the old
house by the Blackfriars—the Blackfriars’ Wynd, as they
call it?’ You nod your head, and he continues. ‘Well,
towards the end of that same lane, if you wish to reach the
convent house, you pass through the ancient wall of the
city by a gate in it which is called the Kirk o’ Field Port.
This will lead you to the Blackfriars’ Church, but not
until you have turned the angle of the wall and followed
the road round it towards the left hand. Within that
angle stands another church, Saint Mary-of-the-Field,
which has nothing to do with what I have to tell you. But
mark what I say now. You go through the Kirk o’ Field
Port; you turn to the left round by the wall; on your
right hand, at no great distance along, you behold a row
of poor hovels at right angles to your present direction—doorless
cabins, windowless, without chimneys, swarming
with pigs, fowls, and filthy children; between them a very
vile road full of holes and quags and broken potsherds.
That is called Thieves’ Row, and for the best of good
reasons. Nevertheless, behind those little pigs’ houses,
on either hand, there are gardens very fair; and if you
venture up, above the thatch of the roofs you will see the
tops of fine trees waving in a cleaner air than you would
believe possible, and find in the full middle of this Thieves’
Row, again on either hand, a garden gate right in among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
the mean tenements. That which is on the right hand leads
into the old Blackfriars’ Garden, a great tangled place of
trees and greensward with thickets interspersed; the other,
on the left hand, belongs to the garden of the house
wherein they lodged the King when they had brought him
from Glasgow. Above the gate could once be seen the
gable-end of the house itself; but you will not see it now
if you look for it. And if you stood in the garden of his
house and looked out over the boskage, you could see the
hotel of the Lord Archbishop of Saint Andrews, the
Hamilton House. Usefully enough, as it turned out, there
let a little door from the corner of the King’s garden right
upon the Archbishop’s house.</p>

<p>‘To tell you of the King’s lodging, it was as mean as
you please, built of rough-cast work upon arches of rubble
and plaster, with a flight of stairs from the ground-level
reaching to the first floor—the <i>piano nobile</i>, save the mark!
Upon that floor was a fair hall, and a chamber in which
the Queen might lie when she chose, wardrobe, maids’
chamber, cabinet, and such like. The King lay on the
floor above, having his own chamber for his great bed,
with a little dressing-room near by. His servants, of
whom he had not more than three or four, slept some in
the passage and some in the hall; except his chamber-child,
who lay in the bedchamber itself, on or below the
foot of the King’s great bed. Now those stairs of which I
told you just now led directly from the garden to the hall
upon the first floor; but out of the Queen’s chamber there
was a door giving on to a flight of wooden steps, very convenient,
as thereby she could come in and out of the house
without being disturbed. All this I observed for myself,
as my master desired me, when Nelson, the King’s man,
was showing me how ill-furnished and meanly found it was
to be the lodging of so great a gentleman.</p>

<p>‘To say nothing of the garden, which, in that winter
season, was miserable indeed, I was bound to agree that
the house wanted repair. Nelson showed me where the
roof let in water; he showed me the holes of rats, the
track of their runs across the floors, and the places where
they had gnawed the edges of the doors. “And, if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
will believe me, Paris,” said he, “there is not so much as a
key to a lock in the whole crazy cabin.” This was a thing
which I was glad to have learned, and to bring to my
master’s knowledge when, at the last moment, he thought
fit to acquaint me with his pleasure. I had heard, in outline,
what it was, on the day before I went to the Queen
at Glasgow; but I will ask you to believe that he told me
no more until the morning of the day when I received his
commands to go to work. This is entirely true; though
it is equally true that I found out a good deal for myself.
My master, you must understand, had not a fool under his
authority. No, no!</p>

<p>‘I did not myself see the Queen for two or three days
after the King’s coming in, though I took many letters to
her and bore back her replies. When I say I did not see
her, that is a lie: I did—but never to speak with her,
merely as one may pass in the street. I was struck with
her fine looks and the shrill sound of her laughter: she
talked more than ordinarily, and never spared herself in
the dance. Once, or maybe twice, she visited the King in
his lodging—not to sleep there herself, though her bed
stood always ready, but going down to supper and remaining
till late in the evening: never alone; once with the
Lords Moray and Argyll, and once with (among other
company) her brother, the Lord Robert, and a Spanish
youth very much in his confidence. As to this second
visit, Monsieur Des-Essars, who was there, told me a
singular thing,<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> namely, that this Lord Robert had been
moved to impart to the King the danger he lay in—that
is, close to the Hamiltons, and with my Lord Morton at
large and in favour in Edinburgh. Now, for some reason
or another, it seems that his Majesty repeated the confidence
to the Queen herself just as I have told it to you.
Whereupon, said Monsieur Des-Essars, she flew into a
passion, commanded the Lord Robert into her presence,
and when he was before her, the King lying on his bed,
bade him repeat the story if he dare. My Lord Robert
laughed it off as done by way of a jest, and the Queen,
more and more angry, sent him away. Now, here comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
what I call the cream of the jest. “You may judge from
this, Paris,” said M. Des-Essars to me, “how monstrous
foolish it is to suppose that the Queen devises some mischief
against her consort, or shares the counsels of any
of his enemies. For certainly, if she did, she would not
provoke them into betraying her in his own presence.”</p>

<p>‘I thanked his honour, but when he had gone I burst
out laughing to myself. Do you ask why? First of all,
none knew better than M. Des-Essars how the Queen
stood with regard to her husband, and why my lord
of Morton had been suffered to come home. None knew
better than he, except it were the Queen herself, that
the King was to be removed, she standing aside. Very
well: then why did M. Des-Essars try to hoodwink
me, except in the hope to gather testimony on all sides
against what he feared must take place? But why did
the Queen bring my Lord Robert face to face with the
King, she knowing too well that his warning had bones and
blood in it? Ah! that is more delicate webbery: she was
a better politician than her young friend. To begin with,
there was no real danger; for the Lord Robert knew
nothing, and was nothing but a windbag. His confusion,
therefore (he was at heart a coward), would give the King
confidence. But, secondly, I am sure she still hoped that
his Majesty might be removed without my master’s aid. I
think she said to herself, “The King gains his health”—as
indeed he did, with his natural skin coming back again, and
the clear colour to his eyes—“and with health,” she would
reason it, “his choler will return. To confront these two,
with a lie between them, may provoke a quarrel. The
daggers are handy: who can say what the end of this may
be? One of two mishaps: the King will kill Lord Robert,
or Lord Robert the King; either way will be good.”
Observe, I know nothing; but that is how I read the
story.</p>

<p class="tb">‘Now, all this while my master was very busy, very brisk
and happy, singing at the top of his voice as he went about
his business—as he always did on the verge of a great
enterprise; but the first precise information I had that our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
work was close at hand was upon 9th February, being a
Sunday. My master lodging at the Lord Huntly’s house
in the Cowgate, I was standing at the door at, maybe, seven
o’clock in the morning; black as Hell it was, but the cold
not extraordinary. There came some woman down the
street with a lantern swinging, and stopped quite close to
me. She swung her lantern-light into my face, and, the
moment she saw that I was I, began to speak in an urgent
way. She was Margaret Carwood, one of the Queen’s
women.</p>

<p>‘“Oh, Paris,” she says, “I have been sent express to
you! You are to go down to the King’s lodging and fetch
away the quilt which lies on the Queen’s bed there.”</p>

<p>‘I knew this quilt well—a handsome piece of work, of
Genoa velvet, much overlaid with gold thread, which they
say had belonged to the old Queen.</p>

<p>‘I asked, “By whose order come you, my good Carwood?”
for I was not everybody’s man.</p>

<p>‘She replied, “By the Queen’s own, given to me by
word of mouth, not an hour since. Go now, go, Paris.
She is in a rare fluster, and will not rest.”</p>

<p>‘“Toho!” I say, “she disquieteth herself about this
quilt.”</p>

<p>‘And Carwood said, “Ay, for it belonged to her lady
mother, and is therefore worth rubies in her sight. She
hath not slept a wink since she woke dreaming of it.”</p>

<p>‘To be short, this gave me, as they say, food for
thoughts. Then, about the eleven o’clock, as the people
were coming out from their sermon, I had more of the
same provender—and a full meal of it. Judge for yourselves
when I tell you with what the vomiting church doors
were buzzing. My lord of Moray had left Edinburgh
overnight and gone northward, to Lochleven, to see his
mother, the Lady Douglas. He had taken secret leave of
the Queen, and immediately after was away. Oh, Monsieur
de Moray, Monsieur de Moray! is not your lordship the
archetype and everlasting pattern of all rats that are and
shall be in the world?</p>

<p>‘Now, putting the one thing on the top of the other,
you may believe that I was not at all surprised to get my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
master’s orders the same day, to convey certain gunpowder
from Hamilton House through the King’s garden into the
Queen’s chamber so soon as it was quite dark. There you
have the reason why the quilt had been saved. Powrie,
Dalgleish, and Patrick Wilson were to help me; Monsieur
Hob d’Ormiston would show us how to dispose of our loads
and spread the train for the slow match. In Hamilton
House it lay, mark you well! I will make the figs in
the face of anybody who tells me that the Hamiltons
were not up to the chin in the affair. How should we
use their house without their leave? There were the
Archbishop and Monsieur d’Arbroath involved. But
enough! It is obvious. And I can tell you of another
gentleman heavily involved, no one more certainly than I.
It was my lord of Huntly: yes, gentlemen, no less a man.</p>

<p>‘It fell out about the five o’clock that, judging it dark
enough for far more delicate work than this of powder-laying,
I was setting out to join my colleagues by Hamilton
House, when my Lord Huntly sends down a valet for me
to go to his cabinet. I had had very few dealings with this
young nobleman, whom (to say truth) I had always considered
something of a dunce. He was as silent as his
sister, my master’s lady, and, after his fashion, as good to
look upon. You never saw a straighter-legged man, nor a
straighter-looking, nor one who carried, as I had thought,
an empty head higher in the air. That was my mistake.
He was an old lover of the Queen’s, whom she fancied less
than his brother Sir Adam. He, that Sir Adam, had been
bosom-friend of Monsieur Des-Essars when the pair of them
were boys, and had shared the Queen’s favours together,
which very likely were not so bountiful as common rumour
would have them. He certainly was a fiery youth, who may
one day do greatly. But I admit that I had held my Lord
Huntly for a want-wit—and that I was very much mistaken.</p>

<p>‘I went up and into his cabinet, and found him standing
before the fire, with his legs spread out.</p>

<p>‘“Paris,” says he, “you are off on an errand of your
master’s, I jealouse; one that might take you not a hundred
miles from the Blackfriars’ Garden.”</p>

<p>‘I admitted all this. “I might tell you,” he says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
“that I know that errand of yours, and share in the
enterprise which directs it. Maybe you have been shown
my name upon a parchment writing: I know that you are
in your master’s confidence.”</p>

<p>‘I replied that I had understood his lordship had been
made privy to my master’s thoughts in many matters, as
was only reasonable, seeing the relationship between both
their lordships: upon which he said, “You are a sly little
devil, Paris, but have a kind of honesty, too.” I thanked
him for his good opinion; and then he says, looking very
hard at me, “Your master is now abroad upon this weighty
business, and has left me to order matters at home. Now
mark me well, Paris, and fail not in any particular, at your
extreme peril. <i>The train is to be put to proof at two o’clock
of the morning by the bell of Saint Giles’, but not a moment
before.</i> You are to tell this to Mr. Hobbie Ormiston, who
will report it to your master. Do you swear upon your
mother’s soul in Paradise that you will deliver this
message?” he says. I promised, and, what is more, I
kept my promise; but at the time I thought it very odd
that my master, generally so careful in these nice undertakings,
should have left the all-important direction of
<i>time when</i> to so dull-minded a person as my Lord Huntly.
To add to my bewilderment, Monsieur Hob also, when I
gave him the message, told me that he had had it already
from his lordship, and had repeated it to my master.
Immediately afterwards we set to work at our little preliminaries,
and were soon sweating and black as negroes.</p>

<p>‘That night there was a supper in the hall of the King’s
lodging, the Queen being there, my master, the Earls of
Huntly and Argyll, the Lord Livingstone and others, with
the King lying on a couch that he might have their
company. They were merry enough at their meal, for I
was working close by and heard them; and I could not
help reflecting upon the drollery of it—for it was droll—that
here were executioners and patient all laughing
together, and I behind the party wall laying the table (as
it were) for an ambrosial banquet for one at least of the
company. It is impossible to avoid these humorous
images, or I find it so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Bastien the Breton had that very morning been married
to Dolet—both Queen’s servants. She had been at their
mass, and (loving them fondly, as she was prone to love
her servants) intended to be present at the masque of the
night and to put the bride to bed. She, my master,
Monsieur de Huntly, and Mistress Seton were all to go;
they were at this supper in their masquing gear. My
master’s was very rich, being of a black satin doublet
slashed with cloth of silver, black velvet trunks trussed and
tagged with the same. My lord of Huntly was all in
white. I did not fairly see the Queen’s gown, which was
of a dark colour, I think of claret, and her neck and bosom
bare. I remember that she had a small crown of daisies
and pearls, and a collar of the same things.</p>

<p>‘At eleven o’clock, or perhaps a little after, the Queen’s
linkmen and carriers were called for. Nelson told me that
she kissed the King very affectionately, and promised to
see him the next day. He was positive about that, for
(being curious) I asked him if he had certainly heard her
say that.</p>

<p>‘“Oh, yes,” he said, “and I’ll tell you why. The King
caught her by the little finger and held her. ‘Next day,
say you?’ he asked her. ‘And when will you say, “This
night,” Mary?‘</p>

<p>‘“She laughed and swung her hand to and fro, and his
with it that held it. ‘Soon,’ she said, ‘soon.’”</p>

<p>‘This is what Nelson told me: he was never the man to
have conceived that charming scene of comedy. Well, to
continue, my master was to escort her Majesty out of the
house, the grooms going before with torches. Her litter
was in Thieves’ Row, as you may believe when you reflect
that our train of gunpowder extended down her private
flight of steps, across the garden to the door which gives
on to Hamilton House. All my work lay on that side,
and there I should have been; but by some extraordinary
mischance it happened that I was just outside the door
when my master led her Majesty out, and so—in a full
light of torches—she came plump upon me.</p>

<p>‘That was a very unfortunate incident, for I was as
black as a charcoal-burner. But there it was: I came full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
tilt upon her and my lord, and saw her face in the light of
the torches as fair and delicate as a flower, and her eyes
exceedingly bright and luminous, like stars in midsummer.
She was whispering and laughing on my master’s arm, and
he (somewhat distracted) saying, “Ay, ay,” in the way he
has when he is bothered and wishes to be quiet.</p>

<p>‘But at the sight of me flat against the wall she gave
a short cry, and crushed her bosom with her free hand.
“O God! O God! who is this?”</p>

<p>‘She caught at my master’s arm. By my head, I had
given her a fright—just as the colliers of old gave that
Count of Tuscany who thought they were devils come to
require his soul, and was converted to God, and built
seven fine abbeys before he died. Her mouth was open;
she did not breathe; her face was all white, and her eyes
were all black.</p>

<p>‘“Pardon, madam, it is I, your servant, poor French
Paris,” I said; and my master in a hurry, “There, ma’am,
there; you see, it is a friend of ours.”</p>

<p>‘When she got her breath again, it came back in a
flood, like to suffocate her. She struggled and fought for
it so, I made sure she would faint. So did my master,
who put his hand behind to catch her and save the noise
of her fall. She shut her eyes, she tottered. Oh, it was
a bad affair! But she recovered herself by some means,
and did her bravest to carry it off. “Jesu, Paris, how
begrimed you are!” she said, panting and swallowing; and
my master damned me for a blackguardly spy, and bade
me go wash myself.</p>

<p>‘It is true I was behind the door, but most false that I
was spying. God knows, I had enough secrets to keep
without smelling for more. But that was not a time to
be justifying myself. My master took the Queen away
immediately, Mistress Seton with her. Afterwards I
heard my Lords Argyll and Livingstone depart—but
not M. de Huntly. I saw him again before I went out
myself.</p>

<p>‘I waited about until I heard the King helped up to
bed by his servants; I waited a long time. They sang a
psalm in his chamber, and talked afterwards, laughing and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
humming airs. They had the boy to amuse them with
fooleries: Heaven knows what they did or did not. I
thought they would never finish. Finally, I heard the
King call, “Good-night all,” saw the lights put out, and
made a move at my best pace to get home, clean myself,
and be ready for the others. Going through the garden
along the edge of my powder-train, I met somebody, who
called out, “It is I, the Earl of Huntly,” and then said,
“Remember you of my words? It is now past midnight.
Fire nothing until you hear the strokes of two. More
depends upon that than you can understand. Now be
off.” I wished his lordship a good-night, and he replied,
“Go you to the devil with your nights.” So off I
went.</p>

<p>‘We all made ready, and assembled in good time at the
door of our house in the Cowgate: my master, M. Hob
Ormiston, M. de Tala, M. de Bowton, myself, Powrie,
Dalgleish, and Patrick Wilson. There may have been
more—it seemed to me that one or another joined us as
we went—in which case I know not their names. We
went down by the Blackfriars’ Wynd, meeting nobody,
through the Kirk o’ Field Port, and round by the wall to
Hamilton House. A light was burning in the upper
window of that mansion, and was not extinguished so long
as I was there (though they tell me it was blown out after
the explosion); but no man came out to join us at the
appointed place. Half the company was stopped at the
corner of the town wall by my master’s orders: he himself,
M. d’Ormiston, and I went into the garden; and just as
we entered, so well had all been timed, I heard Saint
Giles’ toll the hour of two. I lighted the train; and then
we all went back, joined the others (who had seen nothing
dangerous outside the wall), and returned by the way we
had come—no one saying anything. We may have been
half of the way to the Gate—I cannot say—when the
darkness was, as it were, split asunder as by a flare of
lightning, one of those sheeted flames that illumines a
whole quarter of the sky, and shows in the midst a jagged
core of intenser light. And whilst we reeled before it
came the crash and volley of the noise, as if all Hell were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
loosed about us. What became of our betters I know not,
nor what became of any. For myself, I tell you fairly
that I stooped and ran as if the air above me were full of
flying devils.</p>

<p>‘By some fate or other I ran, not to the city, but along
the wall of the Blackfriars’ Garden, a long way past the
Gate, and lay down in a sort of kennel there was while I
fetched up my breath again. Then, not daring to go back
to the Wynd, for I was sure the whole town would be
awake, I considered that the best thing for me to do was
to climb that garden wall, and lie hidden within it until
the citizens had wondered themselves to sleep. So I did,
without difficulty, and felt my way through brakes and
shrubberies into what seemed to be an open space. I lit
my lantern, and found myself in a kind of trained arbour,
oval or circular in shape, made all of clipped box. In the
middle of it were a broad platt of grass and a dial: a snug
enough place which would suit me very well. It appeared
to me, too, that there was a settle on the far side, on which
I could repose myself. Good! I would lie there.</p>

<p>‘The path of light made by my lantern showed me now
another thing—that I was not the only tenant of this
garden. There lay a man in white midway of the grass.
“Oho,” thinks I, “I will have a close look at you, my
friend, before I settle down.” Peering at him from my safe
distance, I saw that he had another beside him; and made
sure that I was on the edge of an indiscretion. If here I
was in a bower of bliss, it became me on all counts to
withdraw. But first I must be sure: too much depended
upon it. I drew nearer: the light fell upon those two who
lay so still. My heart ceased to beat. Stretched out upon
that secret grass, with his eyes staring horribly into the
dark, lay the King whom I had gone forth to slay—stark
and dead there, and the dead boy by his side. By God
and his Mother! I am a man of experience, with no call
to be on punctilio with dead men. But that dead man, I
am not ashamed to say, made me weep, after I had recovered
myself a little.</p>

<p>‘God has shown me great mercy. I am not guilty of
the King’s death, nor is my master. I should have supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
that my Lord Huntly killed him, to save the Queen from
deadly sin, and could then have understood his urgent
instructions to me not to go to work before a certain hour.
If that had been so, all honour to him. I say, so I should
have supposed; but one little circumstance made me
hesitate. Near by, on the same grass platt, I found a
velvet shoe, which I took back with me into town. It
was purchased of me afterwards by Monsieur Archibald
Douglas, that grey-headed young man, for six hundred
crowns; and I believe I might have had double. That,
mind you, told me a tale!</p>

<p>‘The King had been smothered, I consider. There
were no wounds upon him of any sort, nor any clothes but
his shirt. Taylor, the boy, was naked.</p>

<p>‘There, gentlemen, you have a relation of my share in
these dark facts, told you by a man whose position (as you
may say) between one world and another is likely to sober
his fancy and incline him to the very truth.’</p>

<p>French Paris, a jaunty dog—with a kind of brisk, dog’s
fidelity upon him which is a better quality in a rascal than
no fidelity, or perhaps than dull fidelity—has very little
more to say to you and me.</p>

<h3 id="III_CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="smaller">THE RED BRIDEGROOM</span></h3>

<p>Margaret Carwood, the Queen’s woman, had a tale to
tell, if she could be got to repeat it. She had undressed
her mistress, who came in exceedingly late from Bastien’s
masque, and put the bedgown upon her: then was the
time for Father Roche to come in for prayers—if any
time were left, which Carwood could not think was the
case. Would her Majesty, considering the lateness of the
hour, excuse his Reverence?</p>

<p>But her Majesty looked wildly at Carwood and began
to rave. ‘Do you think me leprous, Carwood? Am I not
to be prayed with? Why, this is treason!’ And she continued
to shiver and mutter, ‘Treason! Treason!’ until
the woman, terrified, called up the Chaplain, and he came
in with the rest of the household and began the accustomed
prayers. Gradually the Queen composed herself, and you
could hear her voice—as usual—above all the others,
leading the responses.</p>

<p>In the midst of the psalms of the hour, Carwood said,
there struck on all ears a dull thud, like the booming of
water upon a rock in the sea; the windows of the house
shook, and litter was heard to fall behind the wainscot.
Then complete silence—and out of that, far off in the city,
rose a low and long wailing cry, ‘as of one hurt to death
and desolate.’ Father Roche, who had stopped his <i>Gloria
Patri</i> at the first shock, when he heard that cry, said
sharply, ‘O King of Glory, what’s that?’ and stared at the
window, trembling like a very old man; and nobody else<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
was much bolder than he. But the Queen, stiff as a stone,
went on where he had left off, driving the words out of
herself, higher and higher, faster and faster, until she
finished on a shrill, fierce note:—‘<i>Sicut erat in principio,
et nunc, et semper, et in sæcula sæculorum. Amen</i>‘; and
only stopped there because it was not her part to begin
the next psalm.</p>

<p>A strange midnight picture! There was Father Roche,
the old Dominican, looking all ways for danger, twittering
before the candles and cross; there Des-Essars on his
knees, with his white face peaked and taut; there poor
Carwood, her apron over her head, swaying about; there
old Mother Reres spying wickedly out of the corners of
her eyes at Mary Livingstone, stern as thunder. Erskine
with his white staff stood at the door, two clinging pages
about him; in the midst, at her faldstool, the slim, fever-bright
Queen in her furred gown, praying aloud, she alone,
like a nun in ecstasy. With Father Roche <i>in extremis</i>,
Des-Essars was the first to relieve the strain by boldly
intoning the versicle; but there were no more prayers.
Carwood and Livingstone took the Queen to bed, and
Livingstone stayed with her. Carwood says that she herself
slept ‘like drowned weed.’ When Livingstone woke her
next morning, she heard the great bell tolling at Saint Giles’.
She asked first of the Queen, and was told she was ‘quiet.’
She did not dare any more questions, and remained until
midday inmate of the only house in town which did not
know the news.</p>

<p>Mary Livingstone would say nothing to any one: in
fact, so grim were her looks that no one cared to question
her. Lady Reres kept her chamber. At nine o’clock the
Earl of Huntly came up, with a very fixed face, and was
taken to the Queen’s bedchamber door by Des-Essars, who
went no farther himself, but hung about the corridor and
anteroom in case he might be sent for. Before long he
heard the Queen in distress, crying and talking at once, a
flood of broken words; and, whiles, Lord Huntly’s voice,
sombre and restrained, ill calculated to calm her. Presently
Mary Livingstone opened the door, and he heard the Queen
calling for him: ‘Baptist, O Baptist, come—quick, quick!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Go to her,’ says Livingstone drily; ‘this is beyond my
powers.’</p>

<p>He ran into the room, and saw her lying half-naked on
her bed, face downwards, her hair all over her eyes. She
looked like one in mortal agony.</p>

<p>‘O madam, O sweet madam——’ he began, being on
his knees before her.</p>

<p>She lifted her head. ‘Who calls me?’</p>

<p>She sat up, and parted her hair from her face with her
finger-tips. He saw her transfigured, flushed like one with a
heat-rash, and her eyes cloudy black, glazed and undiscerning.
She was in a transport of feeling, far beyond his
scope; but she knew him, and cleared in his sight.</p>

<p>‘Baptist, the King is dead.’</p>

<p>‘Dead, madam! Oh, alas!’</p>

<p>She gripped him by the arm and steadied herself by it.
She read his very soul; her eyes seemed to bite him. And
she answered a question which he had not asked.</p>

<p>‘How should I know who slew him? How should I?
I know not—I do not ask—nor need you—nor should you.
But there is one who had no hand in it—be you sure of
that. Let none call him murderer—he did nothing amiss.
Do you hear? Do you understand? He is clean as new
snow—and I—and I—clean as the snow, Baptist. O God!
O God!’</p>

<p>She loosed his arm and flung herself down, shaken to
pieces by her hard sobbing. Her face had been dry, her
eyes tearless. If she could not weep, he thought, it must
go hard with her. Livingstone came into the room and
went to her help. She used no ceremony, got into the bed,
and drew the poor distraught creature to her bosom,
whispered to her, kissed and stroked her, mothered her as
if it were one of her own children she was tending. The
Queen clung to her. Lord Huntly drew Des-Essars aside,
into the embrasure of the window.</p>

<p>‘Listen to me, Monsieur Des-Essars,’ he said: ‘I speak
to you because I know that you are in her Majesty’s
confidence. It is very necessary that her friends should
understand what I am going to tell you. My Lord
Bothwell had no part in the King’s death. It is true he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
intended it—I do not attempt to conceal that from you—and
even that he went farther than intent; but the King
was dead before he came. He had his own plans, and laid
them well. But there were other plans of which he had no
suspicion.’ Des-Essars would have spoken; Lord Huntly
put a hand over his mouth. ‘Say nothing. Ask me not who
did it. I was there, and saw it done. I believe that it was
just, and will answer for my part when it is required of me.’</p>

<p>‘My lord,’ said Des-Essars, ‘your secret is safe with me.
I will only say this: If that person of whom you spake
had no part in the deed, then she is free.’</p>

<p>‘She is free,’ said Huntly. ‘I saw to that.’</p>

<p>‘You saw to it—you?’</p>

<p>‘I saw to it. It was I who deceived—that person—and
delayed his plans. There was a time, long ago, when I
played her false. She trusted me, believing in my honesty,
and I forsook her. I have never been able to forgive myself
or ceased to call myself traitor until now. And this
time, when she has trusted me but little, I have served her.’</p>

<p>‘I hope you may have served her, my lord, but——’</p>

<p>‘Man,’ said Huntly sternly, ‘what are your hopes
or mine to the purpose in a case of the sort? Do you not
know her better? She would have had him, had he been
soaked in blood. Well! now she can have him clean.’</p>

<p>Des-Essars knelt down and kissed the other’s hand.
‘My lord, you have given me a schooling in great love.
If the time comes when there shall be need of me, I hope
to prove myself your good pupil.’</p>

<p>‘Get up,’ said Huntly, not pleased with this tribute;
‘they serve best who talk least. But you may be sure
that the time is at hand when there will be need of more
than you and me.’ He looked sadly out of window, across
the red roofs, out into the slowly brightening sky. Des-Essars
was silent.</p>

<p>They announced the Earl of Bothwell. The Queen put
back her hair and wiped her eyes—for Mary Livingstone
had thawed her hard grief. She covered herself up to the
neck. Bothwell came in, with a low reverence at the door,
and made room for Livingstone to go out. She swept by
him like a Queen-mother. Queen Mary beckoned him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
the bedside, and gave him both her hands to hold. ‘Oh,
you have come to me! Oh, you have come to me!’ was all
she could say. She could not speak coherently for her full
heart. He bent over and kissed her; and for a time they
remained so, whispering brokenly to each other and kissing.
‘Have you heard Huntly’s tale?’ she asked him aloud.</p>

<p>He was now sitting composedly by her bed, one leg over
the other.</p>

<p>‘Yes, yes, long ago! We have had our talk together.’</p>

<p>She fingered the counterpane. ‘Belike he told you more
than I could win of him. He will name no names.’</p>

<p>Bothwell laughed shortly.</p>

<p>‘He is wise. Names make mischief. I could wish his
own were as well out of that as mine is. Heard you of
Archie’s shoe?’</p>

<p>She had not. He told her of Paris’s discovery in the
garden; they both laughed at Archie’s mishap. Bothwell
supposed it would cost him five hundred crowns to redeem.
We know from Paris that it cost him six.</p>

<p>My Lord Bothwell’s opinion, which he expressed with
great freedom, was that Morton and the Douglases had
killed the King soon after he had been put to bed. The
body had been cold when Paris found it—cold and stiff.
Then there was a woman, who had been talking with her
neighbours, and found herself under examination in the
Tolbooth before she could end her tale. She lived in
Thieves’ Row. She declared, and nothing so far had
shaken her, that a tick or two after midnight she had heard
the scuffling of many feet in the road, and a voice which
cried aloud, ‘Pity me, kinsmen, for the love of Him who
pitied all the world!’ She heard it distinctly; but, being
in bed, and accustomed to hear such petitions, did not get
up, and soon after fell asleep. Also there had been heard
a boy crying, ‘Enough to break your heart,’ she said.
But it had not broken her rest, for all that. This was the
story, and——‘Well, now,’ says my Lord Bothwell,
‘what else are you to make of that?’</p>

<p>Des-Essars, watching the Queen’s face under this
recital, saw the clouds gather for a storm. Lord Huntly
had listened to it with unmoved face. At the end he said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
gravely, ‘He was long dying’; and no one spoke or moved
for some minutes until the Queen suddenly hid her face
and sobbed, and cried out that she wished she herself were
dead. Lord Bothwell, at that, put his arms about her
with rough familiarity, lifted her half out of bed to his
own breast, kissed her lax lips, and said, ‘That wilt thou
unwish within these few days. What! when thou art thine
own mistress and all? No, but thou wilt desire to live
rather, to be my dear comfort and delight. For now, look
thou, my honey-Queen, thou and I are to get our bliss of
one another.’ She, not responding by word or sign, but
struggling and striving to be free of his arms, presently he
put her down again, and left her. Huntly followed him;
and they went up to the Council, which was set for noon.</p>

<p>‘I remained kneeling by her,’ says Des-Essars, ‘while
she lay without motion, until presently I found that she
was in a heavy sleep. When I went downstairs I heard
that Mistress Livingstone had left the Court and gone to
her husband, Sempill, at Beltrees.’</p>

<p class="tb">The silence of the town during those first few days of
doubt was a terrifying thing, enough to try the nerves of
the stoutest man; it drove the Queen to such dangerous
excesses of exaltation and despondency that all her friends
were on tenterhooks to get her away before the storm
(which all knew must be brooding) should burst. For
what could it portend but a storm, this fatal silence, this
unearthly suspense of clamour and judgment? It was not
that the citizens merely held their tongues from rumour:
it was more literally silence; they talked not at all. If
you walked up the Netherbow or round the porch of Saint
Giles’; if you hung about the Luckenbooths at noon or
ventured any of the Wynds at sun-setting—wheresoever
you went about Edinburgh, you heard the padding of feet
sparsely on the flagstones; but no voices, no hawkers’ cries,
no women calling their children out of the gutters, nor
bickering of men in the ale-shops, nor laughter, nor bewailing.
The great houses were closely shut and guarded; the
Lords of the Privy Council transacted their business behind
close doors; messengers came and went, none questioning;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
the post came galloping down the hill with a clatter which
you would have thought enough to open every window in
the High Street and show you every pretty girl at her best.
But no! So long as the King remained above ground,
Death kept his wrinkled hand upon Edinburgh and made
the place seem like a burying-ground, whose people were
the mourners, crouched, whispering, against the walls—and
all together huddled under the cold spell of the graves.</p>

<p>This continued until the day of the funeral, by which
time it was absolutely necessary that the Queen should be
got away. She agreed—was eager to go; and, before she
went, saw the body of the King, which lay in the Chapel
Royal, upon a tressle bed, dressed up in the gilt cuirass and
white mantle which in life it had worn so bravely. Mary
Seton and Des-Essars, who took her in, were so relieved
to find their anxieties vain that they had no thought to be
surprised. ‘Not only did she stand and look upon the
corpse without change of countenance or any sign of distress,
but she had her wits all at command. The first thing she
said was, “He looks nobly lying there so still: in life he
was ever fidgeting with his person,”—which was quite true.
And the next thing was, “Look you, look you, he lies just
over Davy’s grave!” And then she remembered that we
were within one month of the anniversary of that poor
wretch’s undoing by this very dead; she reminded us of it.
Without any more words, she remained there standing,
looking earnestly at him and round about him; and bade
one of the priests who watched go fetch a new candle, for
one was nearly spent. So far as I could ascertain, she did
not kneel or offer any prayer; and after a time she walked
slowly away, without reverence to the altar—a strange
omission in her—or any looking back. Nor did I ever
hear her, of her own motion, speak of him again; but he
became to her as though he had never been—which, in a
sense that means he had touched or moved her, he never
had. Before the funeral celebrations she went to my Lord
Seton’s house, and there remained waiting until the Earl of
Bothwell could find time to visit her, full of projects, very
sanguine and contented. She said to me one day, “You
think my maids have forsaken me; you grieve over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
Livingstone and Fleming. Of the last I say nothing; but
I can fetch Livingstone back to me whenever I choose.
You shall see.” And she did it before very long.’</p>

<p>On the night following the funeral the profound silence
of Edinburgh was broken by a long shrill cry, as of a
wandering man. Several people heard him, and shivered
in their beds; only one, bolder than the rest, saw him in a
broad patch of moonlight. He came slowly down the
midst of the Canongate, flap-hatted and cloaked; and as
he went, now and again he threw up his head towards the
moon, and cried, like one calling the news, ‘Vengeance on
those who caused me to shed innocent blood! O Lord,
open the heavens and pour down vengeance on those that
have destroyed the innocent!’ Upon the hushed city the
effect was terrible, as you may judge by this, that no
windows were opened and no watchman ventured to stop
the man. But next morning there was found a bill upon
the Cross which accused Bothwell by name of the deed.
It drew a crowd, and then, as by one consent, all tongues
were loosened and all pens set free to rail. The Queen
was not spared; pictures of her as the Siren, fish-tailed,
ogling, naked, malign, made the walls shameful. The
preachers took up the text and shrieked her name; and
every night the shrouded crier went his rounds. The Red
Bridegroom was on all tongues, the Pale Bride in all men’s
thoughts.</p>

<p>The Earl of Bothwell, strongly guarded as he was, took,
or affected to take, no notice of the clamour; but Archie
Douglas became very uneasy, and induced his cousin
Morton to have the nightly brawler apprehended. He was
therefore taken on the fourth night, and shut up in a
pestilential prison called the Thief’s Pit, where no doubt he
shortly died. But his words lived after him, and he testified
through all men’s tongues. Among the many thousand
rumours that got about was one, intolerable to Bothwell,
that the Earl of Moray was about to return to Edinburgh,
and, <i>in the absence of the Queen</i>, act for the general good of
the realm. It was said also that Morton was in correspondence
with him, and that it was by his orders that Mr. James
Balfour, parson of Fliske, was to be arrested and confined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
to his own house. Adding to these things the daily letters
of the Earl of Lennox to the Privy Council, appealing, in
a father’s name, to the honour of Scotland; adding also the
Queen’s letters to himself, my Lord Bothwell judged it wise
to depart the town; so went down to her Majesty in the
country, to Lord Seton’s house, where she still lay. And
as he rode out of town, close hemmed in the ranks of his
own spearmen, he heard for the first time that name which
had been his ever since tongues began to wag: ‘Ay, there
he goes for his wages, the Red Bridegroom.’</p>

<p>The night of his coming, old Lady Reres made mischief,
if any were left to be made; for after supper, fiddlers being in
the gallery, what must she to do but clap her hands to them
and call for a tune. ‘Fiddlers,’ says she, ‘I call for “Well
is me since I am free”‘; and she got it too. Lord Bothwell
gave one of his great guffaws, and held out his hand at
the signal; the Queen laughed as she took it and was
pleased. They danced long and late. But next morning
my Lord Seton made some kind of excuse, and left his own
house, nor would he come back to it until the Court had
removed. With him went the Earl of Argyll.</p>

<p>These departures were the signal for the most insensate
revelry—led by the Queen, insisted upon by her, satisfying
neither herself nor her lover, nor any of her friends. Des-Essars
and the few faithful of the old stock looked on as
best they could, always in silence. Not one of them would
talk to another, for fear he should hear something with
which he would be forced to agree. <i>Le Secret des Secrets</i>
is extremely reticent over this insane ten days, in which
the Queen—it must be said—was to be seen (by those who
had the heart to observe) wooing a man to sin; and when
he would not, after torments of deferred desire, of mortification,
and of that reproach which never fails a baffled sinner,
springing hot-eyed to the chase next day, following him
about, wreathing her arms, kissing and whispering, beckoning,
inviting, trying all ways to lure him on; heart-rending
spectacle for any modest young man, but, to a worshipper-at-a-distance
like our chronicler, an almost irremediable
disaster, since it kept an open sore in the fair image he had
made, and showed him horrible people, with eyesight as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
good as his own, leering at it. Yes! French Paris, Bastien,
Carwood, Joachim, the baser sort—grooms, valets, chamber-women,
scullions of the kitchen, saw his flame-proud Queen
craving, and craving in vain. He ground his teeth over the
squalid comedy. His pen is as secret as death; but it is
said that, on one occasion, when he had seen Bothwell stalk
into the labyrinth, and soon afterwards the Queen, her head
hooded, steal lightly after him, the comments of other
beholders roused him to vehement action. It is said that
he heard chuckling from the base court, and a ‘Did you
mark that? She is close on his heels—a good hound she!’
and saw two greasy heads hobnobbing. He waited, blinking
his eyes, until one began to whistle the ramping tune
of ‘O, gin Jocky wad but steal me!’ then flashed into the
court and drubbed a grinning cook-boy within a few inches
of his life. What satisfaction this just exercise may have
been was spoiled by the reflection that the flogged rascal
knew why he had been made to smart: enough to make
our young knight cut off the avenging hand.</p>

<p>These things weighed and considered, I think that what
little he does say is curiously judicial. He remarks that
the Queen his mistress, restless and miserable as she was,
invited oblivion by eating and drinking too much, by
dancing too much, by riding too hard; that she suffered
from want of sleep; that, as for her love-affair, it was no
joy to her. ‘Hers was a plain case of mental love. But
I say, <i>Hum!</i>—where the Lover makes an <i>eidolon</i> of the
Beloved, and is happiest contemplating that, adorning it
with flowers of fancy, and planning delights which can
only be realised in solitude,—then the bodily presence of
the adored creature effectually destroys the image: a
seeming paradox.</p>

<p>‘Thus, however, it was with my mistress. Never was
man less suited to lady than this burly lord; never did
lady contrive out of material so clumsy master of her
bosom so divine. But his presence marred all, because it
led her to indulge the monstrous reality instead of the
idea. She was generous to a fault (all her faults, indeed,
were due to excess of nobility), and most injudicious.
Her submission to him tempted him all ways—to domineer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
to be overbearing, insolent, a brute; to treat her on
occasion as I am very sure my Lady Bothwell would
never have allowed herself to be treated. But the Queen
bowed her head for still greater ignominy, although more
than once I saw her flinch and look away, as if, poor soul,
she turned quickly, to comfort herself, from the hateful,
real Bothwell of fed flesh to that shining Bothwell of her
heart and mind. In all this she was her own enemy; but
(by a misfortune two-edged) in other ways she contrived
enemies for him. Thus it was an act of madness to make
him presents of the late king’s stud, of his dogs and horse-furniture.
She added—O doting, most unhappy prodigal!—the
gilt armour and great golden casque with crimson
plumes, by which the dolt king had been best known.
Nothing that she could have done could have been worse
judged. <i>Quem Deus vult perdere!</i> Alas and alas!</p>

<p>‘Yet, I must say, it is due to my Lord Bothwell to
remember that he was now what he had always been—not
consciously cruel, not wilful to torment her, and by
no means withholding from her what she so sorely needed
of him by any scruples of conscience. Coarse in grain he
was, and candidly appetent, but as continent as Joseph
when his cautionary side was alert; and, true to his
nation, he was at once greedy and cautious. He was
never one to refuse gratification to a woman who loved
him, if by granting it he could afford any real gratification
to himself. It was a question of the scales with him.
Now, in the present state of his ventures everything must
wait upon security: and security was the last thing he
had gained. He would have pleased her if he could, for
he was by no means an ill-tempered man, nor a cruel man,
unless his necessities drove him that way. And just now
they did drive him. His position in Scotland was full of
peril: he was universally credited with the King’s death,
had few friends, and could not count upon keeping those
he had. In fine, everything that he had consistently
striven after from the hour when he first saw the Queen
at Nancy was just within his grasp. He had climbed the
tree inch by inch, bruised himself, scratched himself, torn
his clothes to rags; and now it seemed that he hung by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
thread—and the fruit could not be plucked yet. The fruit
was dropping ripe, but he dared not stretch out his hand
for it, lest it should fall by his shaking of the branch, or
he by moving too soon. If either fell, he was a dead man.
What wonder if he were fretful, gloomy, suspicious, full of
harsh mockery? What wonder, again, if he seemed cruel
in refusing to ease her smart until his neck were safe?
No, I do not blame him. But I curse the hour in which
his mother bore him—to be the bane of his country and
his Queen. No more.’</p>

<p class="tb">The Court returned to Edinburgh upon the news that
an Ambassador Extraordinary was come from England.
Although there could be no doubt of the matter of his
errand, Bothwell insisted upon his reception. In other
respects the Queen was glad to go. Her malady kept
her from any rest; the emptiness of the days aggravated
it until it devoured the substance of her flesh. She had
grown painfully thin; she had a constant cough—could
not sleep, and was not nourished by meat and drink.
Her eyes burned like sunken fires, her lips were as bright
as blood, but all the rest of her was a dead, unwholesome
white. She said that there was a rat gnawing at her heart.
In such a desperate case it seemed to her friends that the
murmurs and mutterings of Edinburgh could bring her no
further harm: so she went, entered in semi-state, and got
a fright.</p>

<p>Her reception was bad: not cold, but accompanied by
the murmurs of a great and suspicious crowd. She heard
the name they had for Bothwell—‘The Red Bridegroom’—half-voiced
with a grim snarl of humour in the tone.
Nothing was actually said against herself, but she was
acutely sensitive to shades of difference; and after riding
rigidly down to Holyrood, the moment she had alighted
she caught Des-Essars by the arm, and, ‘You see! You
see! They hate me!’</p>

<p>But Mr. Killigrew, from England, and the Earl of
Morton, when she summoned him, soon assured her that
what Scotland felt towards her was as nothing compared
to the common abhorrence of her lover.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span></p>

<p>Bothwell went away to Liddesdale to see his wife. It
is supposed that there was an understanding between him
and the Queen, because she made no objection to his
going, and did not fret in his absence. She saw Mr.
Killigrew alone, in a darkened room, saying: ‘The first
thing his mistress, my sister, will ask him, is of my favour
in affliction; and I know,’—she put her hand on her bosom—‘I
know how thin I am become, and how the tears have
worn themselves caves in my cheeks; and would not for
all the world that they in England should know.’ The
audience lasted half-an-hour; and when Mr. Killigrew left
Holyrood, he went to Lord Morton’s house. Thence, it
was afterwards found out, he made a journey to Dunkeld,
and paid a two days’ visit to the Earl of Moray. There is
no doubt he went back full charged to England.</p>

<p>Des-Essars gleaned all the news he could. He told the
whole to Huntly, to the Queen what he must. The town
was full of dangerous ferment, which at any moment might
burst out. Most of the lords were in the country; most of
them were, or had been, at Dunkeld: Seton, Argyll, Atholl,
Lindsay, Morton, Mar had all conferred with Moray. What
had they to say to him? What, above all, had Morton to
say to him—Morton, who had killed the King? When
Huntly had this question put, and could find no answer to
it, he went directly to the Queen and advised her to send
for her brother. She hated the necessity, but allowed it.
Meanwhile, the King’s father, old Lennox, wrote daily
letters to her and to the Council, crying vengeance on the
murder. He did not hesitate, in writing to the lords, to
name Bothwell, Tala, and Ormiston as the murderers; and
they did not hesitate to repeat his charges to the Queen.
Old Lady Reres, delighting in mischief, underscored the
names in red whenever she could. The Queen was
furious.</p>

<p>‘He is innocent of all—I know it for a truth. Who
accuses my Lord of Bothwell accuses me. It is rank
treason.’</p>

<p>These sort of speeches cannot acquit a man, and may
convict their speaker.</p>

<p>Then my Lord Moray, in a courteous letter, excused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
himself from attendance upon his sovereign at this conjuncture.
His health, he regretted to say, was far from
good, or he should not have failed to obey her Majesty.
The Queen was much put about. Send a peremptory
summons to the Earl of Morton, says Huntly; she did it
without question. Morton came on the night of 8th March,
and Des-Essars, who saw him ride into the courtyard
at the head of a troop in his livery, remembered that on
the same night a year ago he and these pikemen of his had
been masters of Holyrood. What a whirligig! Masters
of Holyrood; then outwitted, ruined, and banished; now
back in favour, and, by the look of them, in a fair way to
be masters again. The bluff lord had the masterful air;
the way in which he announced himself seemed to say,
‘Oh, she’ll see me quick enough! She hath need of me,
look you!’ He was very much at his ease—cracked his
jokes with Erskine all the way upstairs, and, meeting
Lethington at the head of them, asked after his new wife,
with a gross and somewhat premature rider to the general
question.</p>

<p>She sent for her young confidant when the audience was
over, and greeted him with, ‘Now, foolish boy, you shall
be contented. He is fast for us—will say nothing if we
say nothing.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, madam, did he seek to bargain with your
Majesty?’</p>

<p>She laughed. ‘No, no! Nor did I cross his palm with
earnest-money. But there would have been no harm.’</p>

<p>‘Madam,’ he said, ‘you shall forgive me for saying that
there would have been much. It is not for the prince to
compound with treason, nor for a noble, innocent lady to
traffic with the guilty.’</p>

<p>She stopped his mouth, her hand upon it. ‘Hush, thou
foolish boy! What treason did he do? To set me free—is
this treason? To rid me of my tyrant—was this guilt?’</p>

<p>He hung his head, and she watched his confusion; then,
repenting, stroked his face, murmuring, ‘Foolish boy!
Fond boy! Fond and foolish both—to love a lover!’</p>

<p>She told him a secret. She had heard two women
talking beyond the garden wall. They spoke laughingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
together of the Red Bridegroom—‘and of me, Baptist, they
spake somewhat.’</p>

<p>‘I know, I know! Tell me no more.’</p>

<p>‘Of me they spake,’ she went on. ‘“Bothwell’s
wench,” they said, “Bothwell’s——”’</p>

<p>He caught at her wrist. ‘Stop! I will not hear you!
I shall kill myself if you say that word!’</p>

<p>She swung her hand to and fro, and his with it, which
held her so fast. ‘The word,’ she said, ‘is nothing without
the thing—and the thing is not true. I would that it
were! Do you set so much store by names and framed
breaths and idle ceremonies, and call yourself my lover?
Do you tell me to my face that if I called you to come to
me, to stretch open your two arms and clasp me within
them, and to fly with me this world of garniture and
bending backs and wicked scheming heads, and abide
night and morning, through noon-heat and evening glow
and the secrets of long nights under the watching stars,
fast by my side, with our mouths together and our hearts
kissing, and our two souls molten to one—do you tell me
now that you would deny me? Answer you.’</p>

<p>He faced her steadfastly. ‘I do say so. I should deny
you. I serve God, and honour you. How should I dare
do you dishonour?’</p>

<p>She was very angry—shook him off. ‘Leave my wrist.
How do you presume to hold your Queen? Leave me
alone! You insult me by look and word.’</p>

<p>He left her at once, but she sent for him early next
morning and easily made amends.</p>

<p>Driven to it at last, on the 24th of the month she wrote
to old Lennox that Bothwell should be tried by his peers.
She did it partly because Huntly advised it as the only
possible way to stop the growing clamour, but much more
because she wanted Bothwell back. He had been with his
wife all the month; Huntly also had been there more than
once—Adam Gordon, old Lady Huntly. A family council
was, perhaps, in the nature of the case; but all the
members of that had returned a week ago, and why should
he remain? Why, indeed, if (as all Scotland believed) he
had gone to urge divorce upon his Countess? So the excuse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
was made to serve: he was formally summoned; returned
to town on the 28th; made public entry with an imposing
force of his friends and adherents; kissed the Queen’s
hand in all men’s sight, and on the same day sat at the
Council board, and discussed with the others, who were to
try him, the precedents for his own trial. This was no
way to satisfy Lennox or Edinburgh.</p>

<p>The assize was fixed for 12th April. On the 7th of
that month the Earl of Moray left Scotland without leave
asked or leave-taking of the Queen. He stayed a day at
Berwick, and had a long conference with the English
Warden, then took ship and sailed for France. This
should have given her pause, and did for a day or two;
but to a craving nymph, stalking gauntly the waste places,
what matters but the one thing? It made Des-Essars
serious enough, and put French Paris in a dreadful fright.
His master, he said, ‘was fool enough to be glad at his
going; but the Queen knew better. M. Des-Essars told
me that she wept, and would have sent messengers after
him to get him back if she could. Ah, and she was right!
For when yet did that lord’s departure betoken her anything
but harm? Never, never, never!’ says French Paris.</p>

<p>The trial itself was a form from beginning to end, with
the Queen a declared partisan, and the assize packed with
her friends or his. My lord rode down to it as to a
wedding; he rode one of the dead king’s horses—rode it
gaily; and as he departed he looked up at the window and
waved his hat, and all men saw the flutter of the Queen’s
white handkerchief; and some say that she herself was to be
seen smiling and nodding to him. Certain it is that when
he was cleared—a matter of a few hours—and came out
into the light of day and the face of a huge crowd, which
blocked the street from side to side, he was met by
Lethington, bareheaded, and by Melvill, bowing to the
earth, and by the concourse with a chill and rather terrible
silence. One shrill cry went up in all that quiet, and one
alone. ‘Burn the hure!’ was shrieked by a woman, but
instantly hushed down, and nothing was heard after it
but the trampling of horses as Bothwell’s troop went by.
When the Queen met him at the foot of the palace stairs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
he went down on his knees; but many saw the smile that
looped up his mouth. She was very much moved, could
not say more than, ‘Get up—come—I must speak with you.’</p>

<p>He went upstairs with her—they two alone. The
courts and yards of Holyrood were like a camp.</p>

<p>Such a state of things might not last for long. Bothwell
could not go out of doors alone. Even in company
his hand was always at his dagger, his eye for ever casting
round, probing corners for ambushes, searching men’s faces
for signs of wavering or fixed purpose. Strong man as
he was, circumstances were too many for him: he told
Paris one day that he was ‘near done.’</p>

<p>‘Sir,’ says Paris, ‘and so, I take leave to say, is the
Queen’s majesty. If your lordship is for the seas——’</p>

<p>‘Damn you, I am not!’ said Bothwell.</p>

<p>He considered the case as closely as ever anything in
his life, for he was engaged in a great game. He consulted
one or two men—Melvill, Lord Livingstone, his leering
old uncle of Orkney. He sounded Morton, Argyll, Bishop
Lesley (as he now was become); and then he gave a supper
at Ainslie’s, opened his plans, and got their promises to
stand by him. He wrote these out and made them sign.
This was on 19th April, and that night he certainly saw
the Queen. I say ‘certainly’ because Des-Essars, who
was with her afterwards, was told by her that ‘her lord’
had gone into Liddesdale to harry the reivers. Something
in her tone—he could not see her eyes—made him doubt
her: a little something made him suspect that she intended
him to doubt.</p>

<p>So, ‘Reivers, ma’am!’ he cried. ‘Is this a time to
consider the lifting of cattle, when yourself and him are in
danger, and no man knows when the town may rise?’</p>

<p>Her answer was an odd one. She was sitting in a low
chair by the wood fire, leaning back, looking at the red
embers through her fingers. Before she spoke she lowered
her head, as if to put her face in shadow, and looked up at
him sideways. He saw the gleam of one eye, the edge of
her cheek where the light caught it. As he read her, she
was laughing at him.</p>

<p>‘More may be lifted than cattle by these wild men of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
the Border. I am going to Stirling in two days’ time, and
maybe we shall meet, my lord and I.’</p>

<p>He asked her calmly—accustomed to her way of declaring
certainties as possibilities—was such a meeting arranged
for? ‘Come to me, child,’ she said (though he was
not a child), and when he obeyed, ‘Kneel by my side.’
She put her arm round his neck in a sisterly fashion, and
said, ‘You shall be with me to Stirling, and again when we
depart from Stirling. You forget not that you are my
brother? Well, then, brother, I say to you, Leave me not
now, for the time is at hand when I shall need you. I
believe I am to be made the happiest woman in the world,
and need you to share my joy as much as ever you did my
sorrow. Hereafter, for many days, I may have no time to
speak privately with you. Kiss me, therefore, and wish
me happy days and nights.’</p>

<p>He kissed her, wondering and fearing. ‘Oh,’ he said,
‘bethink you what you are about! I beg of you to speak
with my lord of Huntly in this business of Stirling.’</p>

<p>She said, ‘It is done. I have spoken with him: he was
here but an hour gone. And I have Lethington on my
side, and Mary Livingstone and Fleming will both be with
me.’ She laughed at her thoughts; not for a long time had
her old malicious gaiety been upon her. ‘I knew that I
could win back Livingstone. Guess you how I did it.’
And when he could not, or would not, she whispered in
his ear, ‘She believes I am with child by the King.’</p>

<p>Des-Essars had nothing to say, but she kept him by
her, talking of her life about to begin, her joy and pride,
love, duty, privilege, in a way so innocent and candid, she
might have been a child at play. The hours were small
when he bade her good-night, and she said laughingly,
‘Yes, go now. I shall be wise to sleep while I may.’</p>

<p>As he went he stretched out his arms, let them fall, and
shrugged his young shoulders—gestures all of despair.</p>

<p>Where all was prepared beforehand it was not hard to
forecast the turn of events. It fell out much as Des-Essars
had reasoned it over to himself. Upon a fresh spring
morning of flitting clouds and dancing grasses, the Queen’s
party, rounding the shoulder of a green hill, was suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
advised of a company of horsemen, advancing at a leisurely
trot, at some quarter mile’s distance. One could look upon
what followed as at a play; for it may be taken for truth
that not a man, soldier or other, so much as swept the
uplands with his eye, so conscious was he that a play
indeed it was! The oncoming troop was observed in
silence; in silence, without word of command or lifted
hand, each halted at a spear’s throw. The Earl of Bothwell,
with two lieutenants, rode forward, baring his head
as he came. Nobody of the Queen’s men went out to meet
him; nobody hailed him; nobody moved to safeguard the
Queen, who herself sat motionless upon her little white
jennet, in the forefront of her escort, Mary Livingstone
on one side of her and Mary Fleming on the other. The
Earl came to her side, reining up short as his stirrup
clicked against hers.</p>

<p>‘Madam, for your Grace’s protection and honour I am
come to lead you to a safe hold. I beseech your Majesty
take it not amiss in one who desires above all things to
serve you.’</p>

<p>The Queen, in a very low voice, replied, ‘Lead me, sir,
according to your good judgment.’</p>

<p>He took up the rein of her horse, wheeled, and led her
away to his own troop, no one staying him. Mary Livingstone
whipped after her, Mary Fleming followed. Then
the Earl of Huntly, looking round upon the remnant, free
there and armed upon the road, said in measured tones,
‘Follow, sirs, since it seems we are prisoners.’</p>

<p>If play it was, it was not even played properly, but had
been reduced to a spiritless rite. Yet, as Des-Essars has
the wit to remark, to the Queen the whole had been an act
of very beautiful symbolism. He had noticed, as no one
else did, the gesture with which she gave herself up—her
opened palms, bowed head, good eyes, at once trusting and
thankful. Ah! she had been immodest once in her dire
need, panting, blowsed, scratched, dishevelled by her ardent
chase. He had seen her so, and shuddered. But now she
was modest, but now she had regained virginity. A folded
maid sought in marriage by a man, she had bowed her
head. ‘Lead me, sir, according to your good judgment!’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
Thus Des-Essars, fond lover! It is safe to assert that he
was alone in discerning these fine things, as the lining of a
very vulgar business.</p>

<p class="tb">The moment he had the Queen at Dunbar, which was
reached by nightfall, my lord dismounted her and took her
away. Led by his hand, she went without a word to
her women, without any looking back. The rest of the
company was left to shift as best it could. There were
meat and drink on the spread tables; there may have been
beds or there may not. The Queen was no more seen.</p>

<p>Sir James Melvill made an effort, let off a quip or two,
ruminated aloud in an anecdotic vein, rallied Lethington,
flattered Huntly, felt himself snubbed and knew that he
deserved it, but waived off the feeling with his ‘H’m, h’m!’
and recovered his dignity. Huntly gloomed upright; Des-Essars
was bent double, head in hands; Lethington walked
up and down the hall, marking with his eye flagstones
upon which he must alight at every step, or be ruined.
To watch his mad athletics made his gentle wife grieve
and Mary Sempill rage. Most of Bothwell’s men were
asleep; Ormiston was drunk; Hob, his brother, was both.
Gradually silence, which had been fitful, became universal;
and then they heard the wind moaning round the great
house and the sea beating at the black rock on which it
stands. The casements shook, doors far off slammed again
and again, gulls and kittiwakes screamed as they swept to
and fro over the strand; and as the doomed company sat
on in the dark listening to all this, and some thinking with
horror of what could be doing between those two in the
vast wind-possessed house, and some with pity welling like
blood, and some shamefully, and some with wisely nodding
heads—presently, when the shrilling of the birds grew
piercingly loud, one of these banged against the window,
and fought there at the glass, battling with wings of panic.</p>

<p>Mary Sempill rose with a shriek. ‘O God, save her!
O God, save her!’ She was thinking of her Queen.</p>

<p>Nobody moved except Mary Fleming, who felt out the
way to her and put arms about her.</p>

<p>Thus the night went on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span></p>

<p>In the morning Paris came down and said that her
Majesty desired to see Mistress Sempill. She was taken
up, and found the Queen in bed in a darkened room. She
walked to the edge of the bed and looked down, seeing
little. The Queen lay still, one of her bare arms out of
bed; this arm she slowly raised and touched her Livingstone’s
cheek, then dropped it again heavily.</p>

<p>But her Livingstone had now recovered herself, and
could afford to be cynical.</p>

<p>‘Well—Honeypot?’ said she.</p>

<p>‘Empty,’ said the Queen.</p>

<p>Then her Livingstone kissed her.</p>

<h3 id="III_CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="smaller">THE BRIDE’S PRELUDE</span></h3>

<p>French Paris took a letter to Lady Bothwell from
Dunbar, as he thinks, on the day after the ravishing: he
fixes his date from the fact that Sir James Melvill
happened to tell him that it was his birthday, the 25th
of April.</p>

<p>‘Not the first I have spent in durance, my good fellow,’
the genial gentleman had added, ‘although I tell you candidly
that it is the first wedding-night—so to call it—at
which I have assisted in such a place.’</p>

<p>Paris would have prolonged so interesting a conversation
if his master had not been waiting to be dressed. As it
was, he excused himself and hurried up to his duties; which
done, my lord handed him a letter, saying, ‘Deliver this
safely, at your peril; and remember also that whatsoever
my lady shall ask you, she is to have a full answer.’</p>

<p>‘Your lordship may count upon me,’ says the valet,
hoping with all his heart that she would not tax his
countenance too far. Leaving the room, he was recalled.</p>

<p>‘One thing more, Paris. Your mistress will give you
a coffer for me. Guard it well, as you value your neck;
for, trust me, if you come not home with that intact, I will
run you down though you were in the bury of Hell.’</p>

<p>‘Rest easy, my lord,’ said Paris superbly, ‘rest easy
here, and disport yourself as seems good to your wisdom;
for certainly I shall never fail you. Nor have I ever,’
added the poor complacent rogue, and took the thought
with him up the gallows ladder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a singular thing that Bothwell knew his wife so
little as to provide against a line of conduct which she
could never have taken. According to Paris, she asked
him no awkward questions at all, but read her letter calmly,
dipping a toast in white wine and whey as she read. At
the end, after musing a while, looking extremely handsome,
she said: ‘My lord, I see, makes no mention how long
he remains at Dunbar. Knowest thou anything to the
purpose?’</p>

<p>Nothing awkward here; but Paris blundered it. ‘Oh,
my lady,’ he says, conscious of his red face, ‘I suppose
his lordship will stay out the moon.’</p>

<p>‘What hath he to do with the moon, or the moon with
him, fool?’ said the Countess; and soon afterwards sent
him away, as without any value for her.</p>

<p>One can picture him then in the kitchen quarters—jaunty,
abounding in winks and becks; or with the grooms
in the stables—what conversations! The play, dragged
by the weary, high players, must have quickened when
the clowns tumbled through it.</p>

<p>Next day my lady had him up again to her chamber
and gave him letters for Edinburgh: a large packet for a
notary, one Balnaves or Balneaves, another for the Archbishop’s
Grace of Saint Andrews at Hamilton House.</p>

<p>‘Deliver these with speed, Paris, and come back to me—but
not here. I shall be at Crichton expecting you—and
give you a packet for my lord.’</p>

<p>This is how Paris learned that process of divorce was
begun. He dates it the 26th-27th April.</p>

<p>Demure, wide-eared scamp! he was not idle in town, I
assure you; but ran from cawsey to cawsey, from tavern-parlour
to still-room, into all churches, chapels, brothels,
about the quays of Leith, up and down the tenement stairs,
spying, watching, judging, and remembering. He was
most amazed at the preachers, whose licence to talk exceeded
all bounds of belief. There was one Cragg, well
named for a rock-faced, square-hewn man, colleague of Mr.
Knox’s: to listen only to this firebrand! This Cragg—Paris
heard him—rocked screaming and sweating over
the brink of his pulpit, and hailed his Queen a Jezebel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
a Potiphar’s wife, a strumpet of the Apocalypse. ‘And
I could have wrung his brazen neck for him,’ said
Paris, ‘but that all the people stood packed about him
murmuring their agreement. It would have been my
death to have declared myself—and I was vowed to return
to my lord.’</p>

<p>The city seemed to be in the governance of the Earl of
Morton, unsuspected of any hand in the late crime, and of
Lord Lindsay, whom all hot gospellers loved. Close in
with them was Grange—Kirkcaldy of Grange—a very busy
man, Marshal of the City, Captain of the Guard, who kept
surveillance of Holyrood and the lower town. Paris perceived
that he was lieutenant to Lord Morton, a cultivable
person if willing to be cultivated. About his doors, every
day and at all hours of the day, he saw messengers stand
with horses ready. Now and again one would come out
with his despatches bound upon him, mount and ride off—south,
north, west. Similarly, others came in, white with
dust, and delivered up their charges to the porter at the
door. Paris, never without resource, inquired into the
matter, and found out with whom Grange corresponded.
With my Lord of Atholl at Perth! With my Lord of
Moray in Paris! With Mr. Secretary Cecil in London!
Why, this was treasonable stuff, hanging stuff, as he told
his informant—Gavin Douglass, body-servant to Mr.
Archie of the name—who knew it as well as he did.</p>

<p>‘Oh, ay, you make up your mind to the treason o’t,
Paris,’ says Gavin; ‘but I recommend you let not my
master catch you in this town. You have had six hundred
gold crowns of his for the price of an old shoe—he has
never ceased to talk of it, believe me. No later than
yesterday he was at it, saying that pretty soon he could
afford to give all his clothing to the world and stand up
mother-naked as he was born, and be none the worse.
“And to think,” says he, “to think I could be such a
custard-faced loon as to buy back my slipper from a rogue
I shall be hanging in a week.”’</p>

<p>Paris was indignant and hurt. ‘I can see,’ he said, ‘that
the lords of Scotland are at their favourite game of beggar-my-neighbour.
<i>Dieu de Dieu!</i> what else could we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
expected? Your Scotch way: roguery upon roguery,
thieves on thieves’ backs, traitors who betray their co-traitors—hogs
and rats, one and all!’</p>

<p>He left Edinburgh much alarmed at the state of its
affairs, determined to be done with the Countess at
Crichton and back again in Dunbar as soon as might be;
but, greatly to his annoyance, her ladyship, being busy with
her law business, kept him four or five days kicking his
heels: it was the 4th of May before she delivered him her
packet. That was a coffer, strongly bound and clamped
with iron, locked and sealed.</p>

<p>At the moment of his going Lady Bothwell said
to him, ‘Tell my lord, Paris, that this day he and I
are free of each other; tell him that here I am and here
remain.’</p>

<p>Paris, always the servant of a fine woman, knelt upon
one knee. ‘My lady,’ he said, ‘your ladyship has never
loved me, but I take God to witness that I have ever
honoured your ladyship. Albeit I am a poor devil of a
lacquey, madam, I have wit enough to know a great lady
when I see her.’</p>

<p>Said the Countess: ‘If you think that I have a disliking
for you, Paris, you are mistaken. I neither love nor hate
you. I have never thought about you.’</p>

<p>‘Madam,’ said he, ‘why should your ladyship? I shall
venture, none the less, to pray God give you all health,
fame, and happiness.’</p>

<p>Lady Bothwell sat bolt upright, one firm hand on the
table. ‘Health I have from God already. Fame, if you
mean good fame, I have kept for myself. Happiness, if
that lies in the satisfaction of abiding desire, I intend to
have before long. Now begone with your charge.’</p>

<p>He went out shaking his head, muttering to himself:
‘Terrible lady! fine, carven, deep-eyed lady! What is her
abiding desire?’</p>

<p>He found out afterwards.</p>

<p>The coffer and he came safe to Dunbar and into the
presence of their master. The Queen was in the room:
red eyes, hot patches in her cheeks, a swinging foot, fingers
a-tap on the table——‘Ho! a tiff,’ thinks Paris.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span></p>

<p>My Lord Bothwell hands over the coffer, or rather
puts it on the table by the Queen’s elbow. ‘Here is
your testimony, <i>ma mie</i>. By my advice you burn every
scrap of it.’</p>

<p>‘Shall I burn what has cost me so much, and you, it
seems, so little?’ she asked bitterly. ‘Is it nothing to you
that I have written with my blood and sealed with my
tears?’</p>

<p>‘I had not analysed the ink,’ said my lord; ‘and if I
had I should value your honour more. However, you
must do what you will.’ She left him without answer; and
by and by Des-Essars presented himself, saying that he
had her Majesty’s command to take charge of the coffer for
her. Something in message or messenger seemed to anger
the Earl. ‘Damn you, French monkey, you take too much
in charge. Must her Majesty always have an ear to pull
or a cheek to pinch? Man, Baptist, for two pence I’d have
both your lugs off and a hot iron at your cheeks: with a
broad C branded there, my man: ay, by God, and a double
C! Chamberer Convict, man, Baptist!’</p>

<p>He worked himself crimson in the face, his eyes savage
and red. ‘Mind your ways, young sir, mind your ways’—he
threatened with his fist,—‘I warn ye mind your ways
just now—lest you come into the deep mire, man, where
no ground is.’</p>

<p>Des-Essars drilled his slim body to attention, and fixed
his eyes on the opposite wall. The Earl glared at him
open-mouthed, and fingered his dagger as though he
itched to be at it. But presently he scoffed at himself—‘A
white-faced boy to stand by side o’ me!’ He
turned: ‘Take your coffer, master, and be out of this.
A little more and I might colour you finely.’</p>

<p>Des-Essars removed both coffer and himself. Paris was
trembling: he knew that what he had to report of Edinburgh’s
doings would not make matters any better. Nor
did they—though it may be doubted whether they could
have made matters any worse.</p>

<p class="tb">The joys of love—love’s moment of victory, love’s rest,
and possession of the spoils—are gossamer things: an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
adverse breath may shred them away. As for Love himself,
you may call him a Lord or a Beast, give him his roseate
wings or his cloven hoofs and tail: certainly there never
was in the world so refined a glutton. Perfection is what
he claims, no less; perfection of leisure to obtain, perfection
of content, and all according to that standard of mind which,
in a field without limit, grudges the stirring of a filament
as a hindrance to the enormous calm he covets, and sees
in a speck of sand a blemish upon his prize. ‘Alas! no
man, no kingdom of this world, no ordering attainable by
mortal minister could have appeased Queen Mary. She
was made to hunt for happiness and never to find it. She
had risked all upon this cast of hers, had made it, at her
last gasp had fallen upon the quarry. And now, clutching
it, eyeing the coverts fearfully to right and left, starting at
a whisper, cowering at the lightest shadow—like a beast of
prey, she had no time to taste what she had so hardly won.
O miserably stung by the rankling arrow! Poor Io,
spurred by the gad-fly, what rest for thee? Come, ye
calm-browed beneficent goddesses of the night! Handmaids
of Death, come in! and with cool finger-tips close
down these aching lids, and on these burning cheeks lay
the balm of the last kiss; so the mutinous, famishing heart
shall contend with Heaven no more!’ The dithyrambic
cry of Des-Essars does not indicate a comfortable state of
things at Dunbar.</p>

<p>The Queen was madly in love, aching to be possessed,
but knowing herself insecurely possessed. Her tyrant,
master, beloved—whatever Bothwell may have desired to
be—was harassed by events, and could not play the great
lover even if he would. Rebellion gathered outside his
stronghold, and he knew every surge of it; he was not safe
from disaffection within doors, and had to watch for it
like a cat at a mousehole. If the Queen had sinned to get
a lover, he had risked his head to wive a queen. Well,
and he had not got her yet, though she asked for nothing
better all day and night. Queens and what they carry are
not got by highway robbery: it’s not only a question of
kissing. You may steal a Queen for the bedchamber—but
there’s the Antechamber to be quieted, there’s the Presence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
Chamber to be awed, there’s the Throne Room to be
shocked into obsequiousness: ah, and the Citadel to be
taught to fly your banner. Brooding on these things—all
to do except one—his lordship had no time for transports,
and no temper neither. When the Queen wept he swore,
when she pleaded he refused her, when she sulked he
showed his satisfaction at being let alone, and when she
stormed he stormed loudlier. He was not a man of fine
perceptions: that was his strength, he knew. By the
Lord, said he, let others, let her, know it too! And the
sooner the better.</p>

<p>She would not discuss politics. Dunbar, which was to
have been her bride-bower, should be so still, in defiance of
beastly fact. She refused to hear what Paris had to say of
Edinburgh pulpits, of Morton’s men-at-arms, Grange’s
flying messengers. When Bothwell spoke of the Prince at
Stirling she promised him a new prince at Dunbar; when
he cried out threats against Archie Douglas she stopped
his mouth with kisses; when he summoned Liddesdale to
arms she pouted because her arms were not enough for
him. It was mad, it was unreasonable, it fretted him to
feverish rages. He gnashed his teeth. Lethington kept
rigidly out of his way: he was really in danger, and knew
it; not a day passed but he made some plan of escape.
Melvill spoke in whispers, could not have stood on more
ceremony with his Maker. Huntly was always on the
verge of a quarrel; and as for poor little Des-Essars, you
know how he stood.</p>

<p>There came anon swift confirmation of Paris’ fears: a
letter from Hob Ormiston, now in Edinburgh, to his brother
the Black Laird. Both worthies had been, as we know,
with Bothwell on the night of Kirk o’ Field. Hob wrote
that Kirkcaldy of Grange had met him after sermon in a
company of people, taxed him with the King’s murder and
threatened him with arrest ‘in the Queen’s name and for
her honour.’ He went in fear, did Hob; his life was in it.
Now, might he not clear himself? Let his lordship of
Bothwell be sounded upon that, who knew that he was as
guiltless of that blood as his lordship’s self. It would be
black injustice that an innocent Hob should suffer while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
a blood-guttered Archie went scot-free, and a crowning
indignity that he should perish under the actual guilty
hands. For well he knew that my L—d of M——n stood
behind Grange. Ormiston, with this crying letter in hand,
sought out his master, and found him on the terrace overlooking
the sea, walking up and down with the Queen and
Lord Huntly. As he approached he saw her Majesty
cover her mouth and strangle a yawn at birth.</p>

<p>Bothwell read the letter through, and handed it to the
Queen. She also read it hastily. ‘Innocent!’ she mocked,
with a curling, sulky lip, ‘the innocent Hob—a good word!
But this letter concerns you, Huntly, more than me.’</p>

<p>In turn the dark young lord read it. He was much
longer at it, slower-witted; and before he was half-way
through for the second time the Queen was out of
patience.</p>

<p>‘Well! well! What do you make of it, you who know
the very truth and do not choose to declare it? Are our
friends to be cleared, or will you see them all butchered for
the Douglases’ sake?’</p>

<p>He did not answer for a while, but looked far oversea
with those hawk-eyes of his, which seemed able to rend the
garniture of Heaven and descry the veiled secrets of God.
When he turned his face towards her it was a far nobler
than the soured face he looked upon.</p>

<p>‘But to clear them, madam—Hob and the like of Hob—am
I to betray them that trusted me?’</p>

<p>She gave a thring of the shoulder, a fierce flash of her
eye, and turned shortly, and went away by herself. There
was a hot wrangle between the three men afterwards—in
which Bothwell did not scruple to curse his brother-in-law
for ‘meddling in what concerned him not,’ or (if he must
meddle) for not meddling well<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>; but Huntly could not be
moved.</p>

<p>Things like these drove Bothwell into action—to go
through with his business, possess himself of Edinburgh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
and the Prince, and marry the Queen? Why not? He
was free, he had her in the crook of his arm; he had but to
go up to blow away the fog of dissidence: <i>afflavit ventus</i>,
etc.! He urged her Majesty, lectured Lethington, conferred
with Huntly, and got agreement, more or less. Well then,
advance banners, and let the wind blow!</p>

<p>At the first tidings of the Queen’s approach, the Earl of
Morton and his belongings—his Archie Douglas, his
Captain Cullen, his Grange—departed the city and repaired
to Stirling. This gave fair promise; and even the greeting
she got when, pacing matronly by Bothwell’s side, surrounded
by a live hedge of Bothwell’s spears, she entered
the gates and went down to Holyrood, was so far good that
it was orderly. No salutations, no waving of bonnets; but
close observation, a great concourse in a great quiet. She
did not like that, though Bothwell took no notice. He had
not expected to be welcome; and besides, he had other
things to think of.</p>

<p>I extract the following from Des-Essars:—</p>

<p>‘The Queen had a way of touching what she was pleased
with. She was like a child in that, had eyes in her fingers,
could not keep her hands away, never had been able. To
stroke, fondle, kiss, was as natural to her as to laugh aloud
when she was pleased, or to speak urgently through tears
when she was eager. I remember that, as we rode that day
into the suburb of Edinburgh, she, being tired (for the way
had been hot and long), put her hand on my shoulder; and
that my lord looked furiously; and that she either could not,
or would not see him. I had had reason only lately to
suspect him of jealousy, though she as yet had never had
any. But for this very innocent act of hers he rated her
without stint or decorum when we were at Holyroodhouse;
and as for me, I may say candidly that I walked with
death as my shadow, and never lay down in my bed
expecting to get out of it on the morrow.</p>

<p>‘The effect of his unreason upon her, when she could
be brought to believe in it, was of the unhappiest. It lay
not in her nobility to subserve ignoble suspicions. Our
intercourse, far from ceasing out of deference to him, was
therefore made secret, and what was wholly innocent stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
vested in the garb of a dear-bought sin—an added zest
which she had been much better without. I was removed
from all direct service of her—for he saw to that; but she
found means of communicating with me every day; waited
for me at windows, followed me with her eyes, had little
speedy, foolish signals of her own—a finger in her mouth, a
hand to her side, her bosom touched, her head held askew,
her head hung, a smile let to flutter—all of which were
to be so much intelligence between us. She excelled in
work of the kind, was boundlessly fertile, though I was
a sad bungler. But, God forgive me! I soon learned
in that blissful school, and became, I believe, something
of a master.</p>

<p>‘I was not the only man of whom he was jealous, by
any means. There was my Lord Livingstone, a free-living,
easy man of advanced age, who had been accustomed to
fondle her Majesty as his own daughter, and saw no reason
to desist, being given none by herself. But one day my
lord came in and found him with his hand on her shoulder.
Out he flung again, with an oath; and there was a high
quarrel, with daggers drawn. The Queen, who could never
be curbed in this kind of way by any one, lover or beloved,
dared his lordship to lay a finger on Livingstone; and he
did not. There was also my lord of Arbroath, who had
pretensions and a mind of his own; to whom she gave a
horse, and induced more high words. There was my Lord
Lindsay, who admired her hugely and said so: but to follow
all the wandering of unreason in a gentleman once his own
master, were unprofitable. All that I need add (for the
sake of what ensued upon it) is that one day Mr. Secretary
Lethington came into the Cabinet all grey-faced and
shaking as with a palsy, and laid his hands upon the
Queen’s chair, saying fearfully: “Sanctuary, madam,
sanctuary! I stand in peril of my life.” It appeared that
my lord, who abhorred him, had drawn on him in full hall.
So then once more she grew angry and forbade his lordship
to touch a hair of Lethington’s head: “For so sure as you
do it,” she said, “I banish you the realm.” For the
moment he was quite unnerved, and began to babble of
obedience and his duty; and I say, let God record of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
lady in that time of her disgrace that she had not forgotten
how to stand as His vicegerent in Scotland.</p>

<p>‘Affairs went from bad to worse with her. We learned
every day by our informers how the lords were gaining
strength in the west, and stood almost in a state of war
against us. They were close about the Prince—the chiefs
of their faction being the Earls of Mar, Atholl, Argyll,
Glencairn, and Morton. With them was Grange, the best
soldier in the kingdom; and Lord Lindsay would have
gone over, but that he grossly loved the Queen and could
not keep his eyes off her. Letters intercepted from and to
England made it certain that the Queen of that country
was supporting our enemies and preparing for our ruin—nor
was it without reason, as I am bound to confess, for the
safety of our young prince imported the welfare of her
country as well as ours; and it may well have been distasteful
to her English Majesty to have the fingers of the
Earl of Bothwell so near to dipping in her dish. As if
these troubles were not enough, we were presently to hear
of flat rebellion under the Queen’s very eyes, when we were
told that Mr. Cragg, the preacher, would not read out the
banns of marriage. That same was a stout man, after Mr.
Knox’s pattern. It is true they forced him by a writ to
publish them, but neither summons before the council nor
imminent peril of worse would keep his tongue quiet. He
daily railed against those he was about to join in wedlock,
and had to be banished the realm.</p>

<p>‘Hard-faced was the Queen through these disastrous
days, and all stony within; bearing alike, with weary, proud
looks, the indifference of her trusted friends, the insolent
suspicions of my lord of Bothwell, the constant rumours,
even the shameful reports, put about concerning herself, as
if she was ignorant of them. She was not, she could not
be ignorant, but she was utterly negligent. To her but one
thing was of concern—his love; and until she was sure of
that all else might go as it would. True, he was jealous:
at one time she had thought that a hopeful sign. But when
she found out that in spite of her kindness he remained
indifferent; when he abstained from her company and bed,
when he absented himself for two days together—and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
still jealous—she was bound to doubt the symptom. It
wanted but one thing, in truth, to break down her pride and
trail her lovely honour in the dust: and she had it sharp
and stinging. O unutterable Secret of Secrets, never to be
divulged but in this dying hour when she must ask for <i>pity</i>,
since honest dealing is denied to her! She was stung—down
fell she—and I saw her fall—heart-broken, and was
never more the high Huntress, the Queen “delighting in
arrows.” My pen falters, my tears blind me; but write it
I must: her fame, her birthright, nay, her gracious head,
are in dire peril.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>‘It was commonly suspected that Lethington was
desirous of escaping to the lords at Stirling, among whom
he could count upon one firm friend in the Earl of Atholl.
To say nothing that he went hourly in fear of my lord of
Bothwell, and believed that the Queen distrusted him, he
had been too long in the Earl of Moray’s pocket—kept
there as a man keeps a ferret—to be happy out of it.
Nominally at large, a pretty shrewd watch was kept upon
him, since it would not have been at all convenient to have
him at large among her Majesty’s enemies. He knew too
much, and his wife, that had been Mistress Fleming, more
than he. Therefore it was not intended that he should
leave us. Yet I am certain that no day passed in which he
did not make some plan of escape.</p>

<p>‘It was for a step in one of such schemes, I suppose,
though I cannot see how it should have helped him, that on
the day before my lord of Bothwell was created Duke of
Orkney, and three days before the marriage, he gave the
Queen a thought which very soon possessed her altogether.</p>

<p>‘My lord was away, but expected back that night;
Lethington, being with some others in the Queen’s Cabinet
when the talk fell upon the Countess of Bothwell, told her
Majesty that the lady was dwelling at Crichton. He said
it very skilfully—<i>quasi</i> negligently and by the way—but
instantly she caught at it, and took it amiss. “She has
cast him off—let him cast her off. Crichton! Crichton!
Why, he holds it of me! How then should Jean Gordon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
be there? <i>Or do we share, she and I?</i>” She spoke in her
petulant, random way of hit or miss, meaning (it is likely)
no more than that she was weary of Lethington. But he
coughed behind his hand, and rising up suddenly, went to
the window. The Queen marked the action, and called
him back.</p>

<p>‘“Come hither, Mr. Secretary,” said she quietly; and
he returned at once to her side.</p>

<p>‘“You will please to explain yourself,” she said. Very
quiet she was, and so were we all.</p>

<p>‘He began vast excuses, floundering and gasping like a
man in deep water. The more he prevaricated the more
steadfast she became in pursuit; and so remained until she
had dragged out of him what he knew or had intended
to imply. The sum and substance was that Paris (a valet
of my lord’s) had of late taken letters to and from
Crichton: common knowledge, said Lethington. And
then, after a good deal, not to the purpose, he declared
that my lord had spent two several nights there since the
Court had returned to Edinburgh from Dunbar.</p>

<p>‘The Queen, being white even to the lips, said faintly
at the end that she did not believe him. Lethington
replied that nothing but his duty to her would have induced
him to relate facts so curious; the which, he added, must
needs concern her Majesty, the Fountain of Honour, who,
unsullied herself, could not brook defilement in any of the
tributaries of her splendour. She dismissed us all with a
wave of her hand—all but Mistress Sempill (who had been
Mistress Livingstone), who stayed behind, and whose
ringing voice I heard, as I shut the door, leap forward to
be at grips with the calumny.</p>

<p>‘She had recovered her gallantry by the evening. Incredible
as it may seem, it is true that she publicly taxed
my lord with the facts charged against him, when he
returned. He did not start or change colour—looked
sharply at her for an instant, no more.</p>

<p>‘“Jealous, my Queen?” he asked her, laughing.</p>

<p>‘“And if I am, my lord, I have an example before
me,” said she. “Have you not been pleased to condemn
me in regard to this poor boy?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I bore that with what face I could: he regarded me
with the look of a wild hog that grates his tooth. Anon
he said: “Master Baptist and I know each other of old.
I believe I can give as good account of the reckonings
between my staff and his back as——Well, this is
unprofitable jesting. Now, let me understand. Your
Grace charges me with—what in particular?”</p>

<p>‘“Oh, my lord,” cried she, with a bold face, “I make
no charges. I did but put you a question: whether you
had visited your Castle of Crichton these late days—your
Castle of Crichton which you hold of me in chief?”</p>

<p>‘He shrugged his shoulders; and “<i>Chi lo sa?</i>” quoth
he, with a happy laugh. “Let your Majesty and me
confer upon these and other high matters of state when my
head is on better terms with my stomach. I am a fasting
man, no match for your Majesty. Your Majesty knows
the Spanish saw, <i>When the belly is full it saith to the head,
Sing, you rascal</i>? I crave your leave, then, to get my
singing voice again.” He took it with bravery, as you perceive;
and, having his liberty, went away singing to supper.</p>

<p>‘He stayed below stairs for the rest of the night, drinking
and talking with Sir James Melvill and my lord of
Livingstone—ribald and dangerous talk, for he had a lewd
mind, and neither discretion nor charm in the uses to
which he put his tongue. The Queen sat miserably in the
dark far into the night, and went to bed without prayers.
I heard her cry out to Mistress Sempill that she wished
she lay where the King was, and Sempill answered, “Damn
him, damn him!” Next day, with what grace she could
muster, she created my lord Duke of Orkney. That was
done before noon; by five o’clock of the evening he was
ridden away for Borthwick and Dunbar, as he said, upon
State business. In three days’ time she was to marry him,
O Heaven!</p>

<p>‘Early in the morning—the morrow after his going—she
sent for me to come up to her bedchamber; and so I
did, and found her very worn in the face, her hand hot and
dry to the touch. Commanding herself with great effort,
speaking slowly, she told me that she could not continue
to live unless she could deny once and for all the truth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
Lethington’s tale. My lord would not help her. “You
know his way of mockery,” says she. “He laughs to
tease me: but to me this is no laughing matter. Mary
Sempill has been at me ever since——” Here she fretted,
muttering to herself, “I do not believe it—I do not—I do
not,” fidgeting her hands under the bedclothes; then,
breaking off short, she said that she wished me to ride to
Crichton with her that very day. She would take Mary
Sempill—because she would not remain behind—Erskine
would bring an escort; there would be no danger. I said
that I was ready to live or die for her, and that all my care
was to save her from unhappiness. I asked her, Would she
suffer Erskine and myself to go?</p>

<p>‘She stared at me. “Are you mad?” she asked.
“Have you found me so patient, to sit at home in suspense?
or so tame, to shirk my enemies? Nay, my child,
nay, but I will prove Lethington a liar with my own eyes.”
To be short, go she would and did; and we with her, as
she had already contrived it.</p>

<p>‘The weather was hot—as hot as summer—and very
still; riding as fast as we did, our bodily distresses saved
our minds’. We had, as I reckon, some fifteen miles to
go, by intricate roads, woodland ways, by the side of streams
overhung with boughs, encumbered with boulders. The
Queen was always in front, riding with Mistress Sempill:
she set the pace, said nothing, and showed herself vexed
by such little delays as were caused by Erskine sounding
the banks for good fording-ground, or losing the road, as
he once did, and trying a many before he could make up
his mind. “Oh, you weary me with your <i>Maybe yeas</i>
and <i>Maybe nays</i>!” she railed at him. “Why, man, I could
smell my way to Crichton.” I believe her; for now I am
sure that she had steeled herself for what she was to find
there. I knew it not then: she allowed nothing of her
mind to be seen. Nobody could be more secret than she
when she saw fit.</p>

<p>‘That Castle of Crichton stands, as do most of them in
these parts, on a woody bluff over a deep glen, out of the
which, when you are in it, you can never see how near you
may be to your journey’s end. Thus we wound our way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
at a foot’s pace along the banks of a small stream, in and
out of the densest woodland—beautiful as a summer’s
dream just then, with birds making vocal all the thickets,
wild flowers at our feet, and blooming trees, wild cherry
and hawthorn and the like, clouds come to earth and
caught in the branches—and found a steep path to our
right hand, and climbed it for half an hour: and lo! gaining
the crest first, I saw before me, quite close, the place
we sought—a fair tower of grey stone, with a battlemented
house beside it, having an open gate in a barbican. Before
the barbican was a lawn snowed with daisies, and upon
that two white greyhounds, which sat up when they first
saw us, and then crouched, their muzzles between their
paws. But as we advanced, jumping up and barking
together, they raced together over the turf, met us, and
leapt upwards to the Queen’s hand. All beasts loved her,
and she loved them.</p>

<p>‘There was neither guard nor porter at the gates.
They stood open upon an empty court, beyond which we
could see the hall doors: open, they, also. In the air all
about us was the sound of bees, and of doves hidden in the
woody slopes; but no noises of humankind were to be
heard: we all sat there on our horses, and watched, and
listened, like errant adventurers of old time come upon an
enchanted lodging, a castle and hermitage in a forest glade.</p>

<p>‘Mistress Sempill broke silence. “’Tis not for us to
enter—this still place,” she said. “Come your ways,
madam; you have seen what there is to be seen.”</p>

<p>‘The Queen, as one suddenly awakened, called to me.
“Baptist, dismount and help me down. I am going in.”</p>

<p>‘I obeyed, and helped Mistress Sempill after. Erskine
would stay with the guard. We three went through the
gateway, crossed the inner court, and passed the doors into
the hall—a long dusky chamber with windows full of
escutcheons and achievements, and between them broad
sheets of ancient arras which flapped gently in a little
breeze. The sunlight, coming aslant, broke the gloom
with radiant blue bars—to every window a bar. As we
peered about us, presently Sempill gave a short little cry,
then called to me, “Baptist, Baptist, have a care for her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span></p>

<p>‘It was an old woman come out of a door in the panel
to look at us—old, grey and wrinkled. I asked her, Was
any other within? She shook her head, pointing at the
same time to her mouth, within which, when she opened
it wide, I saw the seared stump of her tongue, and perceived
that she had been maimed of that organ. Sempill
remarked it also, and was afraid. “Oh, come away, for
God’s love!” said she: “there is witchcraft here”; and
signed herself many times. But the Queen laughed, and
went up to the mutilated hag, and, patting her shoulder,
went by her through the door by which she had come in,
and turned to beckon us after her. So we climbed a
narrow stair, built in the thickness of the wall round and
round a pillar. In the gallery above were doors to left
and right, some open upon empty, fragrant chambers,
some shut and locked. I believe that I tried them all
the length of the gallery on one side; and so came at the
farther end to a short passage on my right hand: at the
end of that a low-pitched door ajar. Thither I went on
tiptoe, with a strong sense that that room was occupied.
I know not what had certified me, save some prescience
which men have at times. So certain was I, at least, that
when I was at the door I knocked. I was answered,
“Enter.”</p>

<p>‘I entered not. I dared not do it. I sped back to the
Queen, who now stood with Sempill at the head of this
short passage. For the moment my nerve was clean gone:
“Some one there—let us go away!”—Who knows what
hissed foolishness I let fly?—“I urge you: let us go
away.” But the Queen, rose-bright, keen as fire in the
wind, threw up her head and flashed her eyes full upon
me. “Stand aside, sir—I will go in.” She pushed by
me and went into the room without ceremony. We had
followed her with beating hearts.</p>

<p>‘She had not gone far—was not a yard from the door;
nor do I marvel at it, nor need you. For by the open
window sat the Countess of Bothwell at needlework,
making, as I saw in a moment, a child’s shift. If God the
Father of all, who framed women nobly and urged them
cast their hearts in the dust to make soft the ways of men—if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
He, I say, pausing in His vast survey, might have
discerned this dear woman now, with the wound upon her
still raw and bleeding whence she had torn that generous
heart—naked, emptied, betrayed; ah, and face to face
with that other woman also, not less injured, not less the
vessel of a man’s beastly convenience—I dare swear He
would repent Him of His high benevolence, and say, “Tush,
I have planned amiss. The waste is divine, the waster
shall be crowned with the glory of the Magdalene, that
Mary whom I would no more condemn. But what shall
be done with him for whom these women spent so vainly?”
Thus, it might well be, would God reason with Himself.
Yet who am I, poor bastard of a dead mother (spending
she, too, with little avail) to interpret the reproaches of the
Almighty?</p>

<p>‘For an age of suspense, as it seemed to me, the Queen
stood where we had found her—a yard from the door, perfectly
still, but not rigid. No, but she was like a panther,
all lithe and rippling, prest for a pounce, and had her eyes
set fast upon the other. I was in a muck of fear, and
Sempill muttering fast to herself her “O Christ, keep us
all! O Christ, save her!” and the like, what time the
Countess, affecting to be unaware, crossed one knee over
the other and bent diligently to her needlework. The time
seemed a slow hour, though I know not how long it may
have been, before the Queen began to move about the room.</p>

<p>‘I know what made her restless: it was curiosity. At
first she had only had eyes for the lady; now she had seen
what she was at work upon. Yes, and she had been at
the same proud task herself not long since. I am certain
that she was just then more curious than enraged. At
least, instead of attacking as she was wont, with her arrows
of speech leaping forward as she went, she said nothing,
and began to walk the room restlessly, roaming about;
never going near the window, but looking sidelong towards
it as she passed to and fro: bright spots in her cheeks,
her hands doubled, biting her lips, longing, but not yet
resolved, to know all. The storm, which was not far off,
gathered strength as she walked: I saw her shake her
head, I saw a tear gleam and settle on her shoulder. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
so at last she clenched her teeth, and stood before Lady
Bothwell, grinning with misery.</p>

<p>‘“O woman,” she said, snarling, “what are you making
there?”</p>

<p>‘The Countess looked up, then down: the far-searching
eyes she had! “I am making,” said she, “a shift for my
fair son that is to be—my lord’s and mine.”</p>

<p>‘“You make for a bastard, woman,” said the Queen;
and the Countess smiled wisely.</p>

<p>‘“Maybe I do, maybe. But this child of mine, look
you, in my country we call a love-child.”</p>

<p>‘The Queen reeled as if she were sick-faint, and had
Sempill beside her in a moment, flaring with indignation.</p>

<p>‘“Come you with me, madam,” cried she; “come you
with me. Will you bandy words with a——?”</p>

<p>‘She was not suffered to get out her word. The Queen
put her away gently, saying, “No, no, you shall not call
her that, lest she may ask you some home questions.”</p>

<p>‘But the Countess was not offended. “Why should she
not? What harm in a name? Call me as you will, ma’am,
I shall never forbid you.”</p>

<p>‘“Have you no shame?” cried Sempill. “And you
divorced on your own motion?”</p>

<p>‘The Countess replied to the Queen, as if it had been
she that spoke. “O, madam, if divorce stands not in your
way, shall it stand in mine? You have given him your
body, as I did mine; and the Church cannot gainsay me
that. But I’ll have you remember that when I got my
child I was a wife; and when you get yours you’ll be none,
I doubt.”</p>

<p>‘At this spiteful speech the Queen, in her turn, smiled.
She was far from that sort of recrimination. Presently she
began in a new and colder tone—remembering her errand.
“Why are you here?” she asked the Countess.</p>

<p>‘She was answered, “It is my lord’s pleasure.”</p>

<p>‘“He is very clement, I think,” said the Queen.</p>

<p>‘The Countess made no reply; and Sempill, who knew
whether clemency had moved my lord or not, did all she
could to prevent the Queen from knowing it also. Unfortunate
lady! She gave her new suspicions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span></p>

<p>‘“You do not answer me, mistress,” she said, in her
high peremptory way. “I said that my lord is clement,
and you make no reply. You will tell me these are your
jointure-lands, I suppose? Let be for that. Tell me now
this—How are you here?”</p>

<p>‘The Countess hereupon, and for the first time, looked her
in the face, her own being venomous beyond a man’s belief.</p>

<p>‘“How am I here? Just as you may have been at
Dunbar, madam—as his kept woman, just.”</p>

<p>‘“You lie! You lie!” cried the Queen. “Dear God,
she is a liar! Take back your lies—they hurt me.”</p>

<p>‘She pressed her side with all her might. I thought
that Sempill would have struck the cruel devil. But she
never flinched.</p>

<p>‘“No, no, I am no liar, madam,” she answered. “You
are his woman, and so am I. Eh, there’s been a many and
a many of us—a brave company!”</p>

<p>‘The Queen was tussling with her breast, but could get
no breath. I thought she was frightened at the sudden
revelation, or confirmation, of how she stood: she faltered—she
cast about—and then she said:</p>

<p>‘“I know that you lie, and I know why you lie. You
hate me bitterly. This is mere malice.”</p>

<p>‘“It is not malice,” says the Countess; “it is the bare
truth. Why should I spare you the truth—you of all
women?”</p>

<p>‘“You hate too much, you hate too much! I have
accorded with you—we have kissed each other. I tried to
serve you. It is not my fault if my lord—if my lord——O
Jeannie!” she said, with a pitiful gesture of stretched-out
arms—“O Jeannie, have mercy upon me—have a thought
for my sorrow!”</p>

<p>‘She came nearer as she spoke, so near that the two
could have touched; and then the Countess, who had sat
so still, turned her head a little back, and (like a white cat)
laid her ears flat and struck at last.</p>

<p>‘“Woman,” she said, “when you raked my father out
of his grave, and spat upon his dead corse, what thought
had you for his flesh and blood? What mercy upon their
sorrow?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span></p>

<p>‘The Queen, when she had understood her, wiped her
eyes, and grew calmer. “I had no thought for you then,
nor durst I have any. Princes must do justice without
ruth; and he was a rebel, and so were you all. Your
brothers Huntly and Adam have read me better.”</p>

<p>‘“Ay,” said the Countess, “the greedy loons! They
put your fingers in their mouths and suck sweetness and
solace—like enough they will read you well. But I am not
of their fashion, you must know.” Stiffening herself, she
spoke swiftly: “And if you could dishonour a dead old
man whom you vow you had once loved, what wonder if I
dishonour you whom I have always hated?”</p>

<p>‘The Queen smiled in a sweet, tired way, as if she was
sorry for this woman. “Do you so hate me, Jeannie?”</p>

<p>‘And the Countess answered her: “Ay, worse than
hell-fire for my dead father’s sake, and for my brother
John’s, whom you slew. And so I am well content to be
here, that you should see me unashamed, owner without
asking of what you long for but can never have; and that
I should see you at my feet, deeply abased.”</p>

<p>‘If her tongue had been a blade and her will behind it
as the hand of one who lived for cruelty, she could not
have got her dear desire more utterly than by these slow-stabbing
words. Content to be here! Yea, lascivious
devil that she was, I could see that she was rolling in her
filthy comfort. But, by heaven, she was redeemed by the
fading breath of the most unhappy lady that ever moaned
about the world.</p>

<p>‘The Queen, I tell you, went directly to her—went close
to her, without thought of fear or sickening of disgust.
And she took the wicked white face between her hands and
kissed the poisonous lips. And she said: “Hate me no
more, Jeannie Gordon, for now I know that we are sisters
in great sorrow, you and I. If we are not loved we must
needs be unhappy; but in that we have loved, and do still
love, we are not without recompense. So we must never
rend each other; but you, poor lover, must kiss me, your
sister, as now I do you.”</p>

<p>‘I ask myself here—and others have asked me—was
this sudden alteration in her Majesty that old sweet guile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
of hers, inveterate still and at work? Was it possible that,
even now, she could stay and stoop to cajole this indurate
woman, to woo her with kisses, kill her with kindness?
I like not to consider: many there be, I know, who do
believe it, Mistress Sempill being one. Who am I to judge
that deep, working heart more narrowly than by what
appears? Such questions are too nice; they are not for
my answering. Candour compels me to record them; but
I can only report what I saw and heard.</p>

<p>‘I heard the Countess give a throttled cry, as she
struggled like one caught in a fire; but the Queen kissed
her again before she could free herself. When at last she
had flung away, with crying and a blenched face—she who
had been so hard before was now in a state of wild alarm,
warning off our lady with her fighting hands. “No, no,
no! Touch me not—defile not yourself. Oh, never that—I
dare not suffer you!”</p>

<p>‘“What, am I so vile?” says the poor Queen, misunderstanding
her in this new mood. The Countess burst
out into passionate weeping, which hurt her so much (for
she was no tearful woman by nature) that she writhed
under the affliction as if the grief within was tearing at her
vitals. She shrieked, “Ah, no! Not you—not you—but
I. Oh, you torture me, brand me with fire!” I could not
guess what she meant, save that she was beaten, and her
wicked passion with her.</p>

<p>‘She sat up and stared at our Mistress, her face all
writhen with grief. “Listen, listen—this is the truth as
God knows it. That man who stands between us two and
Heaven is your ruin and mine. For I love him not at
all, and have consented to him now, degrading myself for
hatred’s sake. And for you, who have loved him so well,
he has no care at all—but only for your crown and royal
seat; for he loves me only—and so it has always been.”</p>

<p>‘The Queen could only nod her head. Mary Sempill
said sternly: “Woman, you do well to lash yourself at
last; for none can hurt you beside yourself. Now, may
God forgive you, for I never will.”</p>

<p>‘“Oh, Mary,” says the Queen, “what have you or I to
do with forgiveness of sins? Alas, we need it for ourselves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
And she is in as bad a case as I am.” Then, “Come to
me now, Jeannie,” she said; and most humbly that wicked,
beaten woman crept up to her late enemy. The Queen
embraced and comforted her. “Farewell, Jeannie,” said
she, “and think as well of me as you can. For I go on to
I know not what—only I do think it will be unhappiness—and
we shall never meet again.” With sublime calm she
turned to us, weeping behind her. “Come, my children,
let us go our ways.”</p>

<p>‘This is the most terrible secret sorrow which broke her
heart, and ends my plea for pity upon her who loved so
fondly. My breath and strength are done; for I had them
from her alone, and with her high heart’s death dies my
book.’</p>

<p>Honest, ingenuous, loyal Des-Essars! seeing, maybe,
but in a glass darkly; seeing, certainly, not more than half—thou
wert right there. If thy mistress beat the woman
at last, it was with her fading breath. She knew herself
beaten to the dust by the man.</p>

him from blood-guiltiness and knew that he could, why not have kept him and
his kegs away altogether? One answer may be, of course, that Morton and
his friends would never have stood in had Bothwell and his been ruled out.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE BRIDE’S TRAGEDY</span></h3>

<p>The heart being an organ of which we have opinions more
gallant than practical, Des-Essars should perhaps have
judged wiselier that his Secret of Secrets was what broke
the Queen’s <i>spirit</i>. There he had been right, for from this
day onwards to the end of her throned life the tragedy is
pure pity: she drifts, she suffers, but she scarcely acts—unless
the struggles of birds in nets can be called acts.
After her spirit went rapidly her animal courage; after
that her womanly habit. She was like to become a mere
tortured beast. And as I have no taste for vivisection, nor
can credit you with any, I shall be as short as I can.</p>

<p>Silent all the long way home from wooded Crichton to
the sea, it might seem as if she had been hardening herself
by silent meditation for what she knew must take place.
She saw nothing of Bothwell that night—she was not yet
ready for him; but she did what had to be done with Mary
Sempill.</p>

<p>When that loyal soul came late into the bedchamber to
bid her good-night, she found her mistress in bed, calm and
clear in mind. Forewarned in some measure, as she
stooped over to kiss her, the Queen did not as usual put out
her arms to draw her friend nearer, but lay waiting for the
kiss, which hovered, as it were, above her; and before it
could come she said, ‘Do you kiss me, Mary? Wait
while I tell you something. I am to be married to my
lord come the day after to-morrow.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span></p>

<p>Sempill, prepared or not, started back, on fire. ‘You’ll
never do it. You’ll never dare to do it.’</p>

<p>‘I shall dare to do it, if I dare avouch it.’</p>

<p>Sempill was trembling. ‘I cannot endure it, cannot
face it—most wicked! Oh, my dear love and my friend,
you that have been all the world to me in times bygone,
never go so far from me that I cannot follow you!’</p>

<p>The Queen bit her lip, and wrinkled her eyes where the
tears were brimming, drowning her sight. ‘I must, I must—I
cannot go back. Oh, have mercy upon me! Oh,
Mary——’</p>

<p>Sempill hid her face. ‘I cannot see it done. I cannot
know of it. I am—I do my best to be—an honest woman.
These things be far from me—unholy things. As Christ is
my Saviour, I believe He will pardon you and me all our
sins of the hot blood. But not of the cold blood—not of
the dry!’ She changed suddenly, as if struck chill.
‘Why, you will be an harlot!’ she said.</p>

<p>The Queen turned over in her bed and faced the wall.</p>

<p>Sempill went down on her knees. ‘I conjure you—I
beseech you! Madam, I implore you! By your mother’s
bliss and your father’s crown imperial, by the great calling
of your birth! By Christ’s dear blood shed for you and
all, by the sorrows of Our Lady—the swords in her heart—the
tears that she shed; by her swooning at the Cross—I
implore, I implore!—make not all these woes to be in
vain. By your young child I conjure you—by my own
upon earth and the other in my womb—by all calm and
innocent things—oh, put it from you: suffer all things—even
death, even death!’</p>

<p>There was no response. She rose and stood over the
bed. ‘We have loved much, and had sweet commerce, you
and I. Many have had sweetness of you and left you:
Beaton is gone, Fleming is alienate. You drive me to go
their way, you drive me from you. For if you do this, go
I must. Honour is above all—and yon man, by my soul,
is as foul as hell. Turn to me, my Mary, look at me once,
and I shall never leave you till I die.’</p>

<p>She did not stir nor utter a sound; she lay like a log.
Mary Sempill, with a sob that shook her to pieces, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
a gesture of drowning hands, went out of the room, and
at midnight left the palace. Those two, who had been
lovers once and friends always, never met again in this
world.</p>

<p>What the Queen’s motives may have been I know not,
whether of desperate conviction that retreat was not possible,
or of desperate effort to entice the man to her even
at this last hour: let them go.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> She held to her resolve
next day; she faced the remnant of her friends, all she had
left; lastly, she faced the strong man himself, and like a
doll in his arms suffered his lying kisses upon her lips.
And she never reproached him, being paralysed by the
knowledge of what he would have done if she had. To
see him throw up the head, expose the hairy throat, to see
him laugh! She could not bear that.</p>

<p>On this day, the eve of her wedding, she found out that
her courage had ebbed. Things frightened her now which
before she would have scoffed at. A May marriage—hers
was to be that: and they who feared ill-luck from such gave
her fears. A Highland woman became possessed in the
street, and prophesied to a crowd of people. She said that
the Queen would be a famous wife, for she would have five
husbands, and in the time of the fifth would be burned.
‘Name them, mother—name them!’ they cried; and the
mad creature peered about with her sly eyes. ‘I dinna see
him here, but the third is in this town, and the fourth likewise!’
‘The fourth! Who is he?’ ‘He’s a Hamilton, I
ken that fine, and dwells by Arbroath. I doubt his name
will be Jock.’</p>

<p>Lord John! The Lord of Arbroath—why, yes, she had
given him a great horse. They rehearse this tale at dinner,
and see Bothwell grow red, and hear the Queen talk to
herself: ‘Will they burn me? Yes, yes, that is the punishment
of light women. Poor souls, they burn for ever!’</p>

<p>She carried the thought about with her all day, and at
dusk was much agitated when they lit the candles. About<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
supper-time Father Roche, asking to speak with her, was
admitted. He told her that his conscience would not
permit him to be any longer in her service. Bothwell had
refused to be married with the mass: in Father Roche’s
eyes this would be no marriage at all. She was angry for
a second in her old royal way—her Tudor way; moved
towards him swiftly as if she would have quelled him with
a forked word; but stopped mid-road and let her hands
unclench themselves. ‘Yes, yes, go your ways—you will
find a well-trodden road. Why should you stop? I need
you no more.’ He would have kissed her hands, but she
put them behind her and stood still till he had gone. Then
to bed, without prayers.</p>

<p>At ten o’clock of the morning she was married to him
without state, without religion. There was no banquet:
the city acted as if unaware of anything done; and after
dinner she rode away with him to Borthwick. Melvill,
Des-Essars, Lethington went with her, Mary Seton and
Carwood. Bothwell had his own friends, the Ormistons
and others of mean degree.</p>

<p>With tears they put her to bed; but she had none. ‘I
would that I might die within the next hour,’ she said to
Des-Essars; and he, grown older and drier suddenly—‘By
my soul, ma’am, it should be within less time, to do you
service.’</p>

<p>She shook her head. ‘No, you are wrong. He needs
me not. You will see.’ She sent him away to his misery,
and remained alone in hers.</p>

<p>It cannot be known when the Earl went up. He stayed
on in the parlour below, drinking with his friends so long
as they remained above-board, talking loudly, boasting of
what he had done and of what he should do yet. He took
her back to Edinburgh within a few days, moved thereto
by the urgency of public affairs.</p>

<p>Those who had not seen her go, but now saw her return,
did not like her looks—so leaden-coloured, so listless and
dejected, so thin she seemed. The French Ambassador—Du
Croc, an old friend and a sage—waiting for audience,
heard a quarrel in her cabinet, heard Bothwell mock and
gibe, depart with little ceremony; and then the Queen in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
hysterics, calling for friends who had gone—for Livingstone,
for Fleming.</p>

<p>Carwood came in. ‘O madam, what do you lack?’</p>

<p>‘My courage, my courage.’</p>

<p>Carwood, with a scream—‘God’s sake, ma’am, put down
that knife!’</p>

<p>‘The knife is well enough,’ says she, ‘but the hand is
numb. Feel me, Carwood: I am dead in the hand.’</p>

<p>Du Croc heard Carwood grunt as she tussled. ‘Leave
it—leave it—give it me! But you shall. You are Queen,
but my God to me. Leave it, I say——’ The Queen
began to whimper and coax for the knife—called it her
lover. Carwood flung open the window and threw it on to
the grass.</p>

<p class="tb">No doubt the worst was to be feared, no doubt Bothwell
had reason to be nervous. At the council-board, to which
he ordered her to come, he told her what was before her.
The lords were in league, clustered about the Prince: he
was not ashamed to tell her in the hearing of all that she
was useless without the child. Dejected, almost abject as
she was become, she quailed—shrinking back, with wide
eyes upon him—at this monstrous insult, as if she herself
had been a child struck to the soul by something more
brutish than your whips. Lord Herries rose in his place—‘By
the living God, my lord, I cannot hear such talk——’ Bothwell
was driven to extenuate. ‘My meaning, madam,
is that your Majesty can have no force in your arm, nor
can your loyal friends have any force, without the Prince
your son be with you. You know very well how your late
consort desired to have him; and no man can say he was
not wise. Believe me, madam—and these lords will bear
me out—he is every whit as necessary to your Majesty
and me.’</p>

<p>Huntly, on the Queen’s left, leaned behind her chair and
spoke in a fierce whisper: ‘You forget, I think, that you
speak to the Queen, and of the Queen. The Prince hath
nothing but through her.’</p>

<p>‘By God, Geordie,’ he said, whispering back, but heard
everywhere, ‘and what have I but through her? I tell you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
fairly we have lost the main unless we can put up that
cockerel.’</p>

<p>The Queen tried to justify herself to her tyrant. ‘You
know that I have tried—you know that my brother worked
against me——’</p>

<p>‘And he was wise. But now he is from home; we
must try again.’</p>

<p>She let her head sink. ‘I am weary—I am weary.
Whom have we to send? Do you trust Lethington?’</p>

<p>This was not heard; but Lethington saw Bothwell’s
eye gleam red upon him.</p>

<p>‘Him? I would as soon go myself. If he wormed in
there, do you suppose we could ever draw him out again?’</p>

<p>‘No,’ she said aloud, ‘I am of your mind. Send we
Melvill, then.’</p>

<p>He would not have Melvill: he chose Herries.</p>

<p>They sent out Lord Herries on a fruitless errand;
fruitless in the main sense, but fruitful in another, since
he brought back a waverer. This was the Earl of Argyll,
head of a great name, but with no head of his own worth
speaking about. He might have been welcome but for the
news that came with him. All access to the Prince had
been refused to Herries the moment it was known on
whose behalf he asked it. The Countess of Mar mounted
guard over the door, and would not leave until the Queen’s
emissary was out of the house. There was more than
statecraft here, as Herries had to confess: witchcraft from
the Queen was in question, from the mother upon the child.
The last time she had been to see him, they said, she had
given him an apple, which he played with and presently
cast down. A dog picked it up, ran under the table with
it and began to mumble it. The dog, foaming and snaping,
jerked away its life. ‘Treason and lies!’ roared
Bothwell, who was present; ‘treason heaped on lies!
Why, when was your Majesty last at Stirling?’ He had
forgotten, though she had not.</p>

<p>‘It was the night before you took me at Almond Brig,’ she
said; and, when he chuckled, broke out with vehemence of
pain, ‘You laugh at it! You laugh still, O Christ! Will
you laugh at my graveside, Bothwell?’ She hid her head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
in her arm and wept miserably. It was grievous to see her
and not weep too. Yet these were no times in which to
weep.</p>

<p class="tb">On the same day in which Lord Lindsay departed, to
join the Lords at Stirling, Huntly also, most unhappily,
asked leave to go to his lands. The Queen used him
bitterly. She could be gentle with any other and move
their pity: with him she must always be girding. ‘Do
you turn traitor like your father? Have you too kept
a dagger for my last hours?’ He did not break into
reproaches, nor seek to justify himself, as he might have
done—for no one had tried to serve her at more peril to
himself. He said, ‘Madam, I have tried to repair my
faults committed against you,’ and turned away with a
black look of despair. He went north, as she thought, lost
to her: it was Bothwell who afterwards told her that he
had gone to summon his kindred against the war which he
saw could not be far off. So scornful are women to those
who love them in vain—that should surely have touched
her, but did not. Lord John Hamilton took Huntly’s
empty place, too powerful an ally to be despised.</p>

<p>The Earl of Argyll came and went between Stirling and
Edinburgh, very diligent to accommodate the two cities, if
that might be. He dared—or was fool enough—to tell the
Queen that all would be well if she would give up the
King’s murderers. She replied: ‘Go back to Stirling,
then, and take them. I do give them up. It is there you
shall find them.’ Whether he knew this to be truth or
not, for certain he did not report the message to the Earl
of Morton. It would have fared ill with him if he had.</p>

<p>Before he could come back, a baffled but honest intermediary,
Lethington had fled the Court and taken his wife
with him. He went out, as he said, to ride in the meadows;
he did ride there, but did not return. His wife slipt away
separately, and joined her man at Callander; thence, when
Lord Livingstone sent them word that he could not harbour
the Queen’s enemies, they went on to Lord Fleming’s,
Mary’s father’s house, and finally to Stirling. It was a
bad sign that the gentle girl, flying like a thief at her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
husband’s bidding, should write no word, nor send any
message to the Queen; it was a worse to the last few
faithful that the Queen took no notice. All she was heard
to say was that Fleming could not be blamed for paying
her merchet.</p>

<p><i>Mercheta Mulicrum</i>, Market of Women—the money-fee
exacted by the lord of the soil before a girl could be wed,
clean, to the man who chose her! Livingstone had paid
it, Beaton had paid it; she, Queen Mary, God knows! had
paid it deep. She shook her head—and was Fleming to
escape? ‘No! but Love—that exorbitant lord—will
have it of all of us women. And now’s for you,
Seton!’</p>

<p>She looked strangely at the glowing, golden-haired girl
before her; the green-eyed, the sharp-tongued Mary Seton,
last of her co-adventurers of six years agone. Fair Seton
made no promises; but all the world knows that she alone
stayed by her lady to the long and very end.</p>

<p>Returned from Stirling, my Lord of Argyll, with perturbed
face, disorderly dress, and entire absence of manners,
broke in upon the Queen’s privacy, claiming secret words.
The lords were prepared for the field. They intended an
attack upon the lower town by land and water; they would
surround Holyroodhouse, seize her person.</p>

<p>She flamed. ‘You mean my husband’s. It is him they
seek.’</p>

<p>He did not affect to deny it. She sent for Bothwell and
told him all.</p>

<p>Bothwell said: ‘You are right. They want me. Well,
they shall not have me so easily. You and I will away
this night to Borthwick. Arbroath will be half way to us
by now, and the Gordons not far behind. Let Adam go
and hasten his brother. Madam, we should be speedy.’</p>

<p>She took Seton with her—having no other left; she took
Des-Essars. Arthur Erskine was to captain Holyroodhouse.
Bothwell had, perhaps, half a dozen of his
dependents. They went after dark, but in safety.</p>

<p>There, at Borthwick, they stayed quietly through the
8th and 9th of June: close weather, with thunder brewing.</p>

<p>No news of Huntly, none of the Hamiltons. Bothwell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
was out each day for long spells, spying and judging. He
opened communication with Dunbar, got in touch with his
own country. At home sat the Queen with her two friends,
very silent.</p>

<p>What was there to say? Who could nurse her broken
heart save this one man, who had no thought to do it, nor
any heart of his own, either, to spare for her? Spited had
he been by Fortune, without doubt. He had had the
Crown and Mantle of Scotland in his pair of hands; having
schemed for six years to get them, he had had them, and
felt their goodly weight: and here he was now in hiding,
trusting for bare life to the help of men who had no reason
to love him. Where, then, were his friends? He had
none, nor ever had but one—this fair, frail woman, whom
he had desired for her store, and had emptied, and would
now be rid of.</p>

<p>If his was a sorry case, what was hers? Alas, the heart
sickens to think of it. With how high a head came she in,
she and her cohort of maids, to win wild Scotland! Where
were they? They had received their crowns, but she
had besoiled and bedrabbled hers. They had lovers, they
had children, they had troops of friends; but she, who had
sought with panting mouth for very love, had had husbands
who made love stink, and a child denied her, and no friend
in Scotland but a girl and a poor boy. You say she had
sought wrongly. I say she had overmastering need to
seek. Love she must; and if she loved amiss it was that
she loved too well. You say that she misused her friends.
I deny that a girl set up where she was could have any
friends at all. She was a well of sweet profit—the Honeypot;
and they swarmed about her for their meat like house-flies;
and when that was got, and she drained dry, they
departed by the window in clouds, to settle and fasten about
the nearest provand they could meet with: carrion or honeycomb,
man’s flesh, dog’s flesh or maid’s flesh, what was it
to them? In those days of dreadful silent waiting at
Borthwick, less than a month after marriage, I tell you
very plainly that she was beggared of all she had in the
world, and knew it. The glutted flies had gone by the
window, the gorged rats had scampered by the doors. So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
she remained alone with the man she had risked all to get,
who was scheming to be rid of her. Her heart was broken,
her love was murdered, her spirit was gone: what more
could she suffer? One more thing—bodily terror, bodily
fear.</p>

<h3 id="III_CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="smaller">THE KNOCKING AT BORTHWICK</span></h3>

<p>The 10th of June had been a thunderous day, and was
followed by a stifling night. In the lower parlour where
the Queen lay the candles seemed to be clogged, the air
charged with steam. Mary Seton sat on the floor by the
couch, Des-Essars, bathed in sweat, leaned against the
window-sill. In the hall beyond could be heard Bothwell’s
voice, grating querulously to young Crookstone and Paris
about his ruined chances. He was not laughing any more—was
not one, it was found, to bear misfortunes gaily.
His tongue had mastered him of late, and his hand too. He
had nearly killed Paris that morning with one smashing blow.</p>

<p>There came a puff of wind, with branches sweeping the
window, the pattering, swishing sound as of heavy rain.
‘Thank God for rain! Baptist, the window, lest I suffocate.
The rain will cool the air.’ He set it wide open, and
leaned out. There was no rain at all; but the sky was a
vaporous vault, through which, in every part, the veiled
moon diffused her light. He saw a man standing on the
grass as plainly as you see this paper, who presently, after
considering him, went away towards the woods. It might
have been one of their own sentries, it might have been any
one: but why did it make his heart beat? He stayed
where he was, watching intently, considering with himself
whether he should tell the Queen, or by some ruse let my
lord have warning without her knowledge. Then, while he
was hammering it out, she got up and came to the window,
and leaned over him, her hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Poor prisoners, you and I, my Baptist.’</p>

<p>He turned to her with burning eyes. ‘Madam, there
can be no prison for me where you are; but my heart
walks with yours through all space.’</p>

<p>‘My heart,’ she said, ‘limps, and soon will be bedridden;
and then yours will stop. You are tied to
me, and I to him. The world has gone awry with us, my
dear.’</p>

<p>Very nervous, on account of what he had seen, he had
no answer ready. Thought, feeling, passion, desire, were
all boiling and stirring together in his brain. The blood
drummed at his ears, like a call to arms.</p>

<p>Suddenly—it all came with a leap—there was hasty
knocking at the hall doors, and at the same instant a bench
was overturned out there, and Bothwell went trampling
towards the sound. Des-Essars, tensely moved, shut the
windows and barred the shutters over them. The Queen
watched him—her hands held her bosom. ‘What is it?
Oh, what is it?’</p>

<p>‘Hush, for God’s sake! Let me listen.’</p>

<p>Mary Seton opened the parlour door, as calm as she
had ever been. They listened all.</p>

<p>They heard a clamour of voices outside. ‘Bothwell!
Bothwell! Let us in.’</p>

<p>‘Who are ye?’</p>

<p>‘We are hunted men—friends. We are here for our
lives.’</p>

<p>Bothwell put his ear close to the door; his mouth
worked fearfully, all his features were distorted. Heavens!
how he listened.</p>

<p>‘Who are ye? Tell me that.’</p>

<p>‘Friends—friends—friends!’</p>

<p>He laughed horribly—with a hollow, barking noise, like
a leopard’s cough. ‘By my God, Lindsay, I know ye
now for a fine false friend. You shall never take me
here.’</p>

<p>For answer, the knocking was doubled; men rained
blows upon the door; and some ran round to the windows
and jumped up at them, crying, ‘Let us in—let us in!’
Some glass was broken; but the shutter held. Mary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
Seton held the Queen close in her arms, Des-Essars
stood in the doorway with a drawn sword. Bothwell
came up to him for a moment. ‘By God, man, we’re rats
in a drain—damned rats, by my soul! Ha!’ he turned as
Paris came down from the turret, where he had been sent
to spy.</p>

<p>The house, Paris said, was certainly surrounded. The
torches made it plain that these were enemies. He had
seen my lord of Morton on a white horse, my Lords
Hume and Sempill and some more.</p>

<p>They all looked at each other, a poor ten that they
were.</p>

<p>‘Hark to them now, master,’ says Paris. ‘They have
a new cry.’</p>

<p>Bothwell listened, biting his tongue.</p>

<p>‘Murderer, murderer, come out! Come out, adulterous
thief!’ This was Lindsay again. There was no sound of
Morton’s voice, the thick, the rich and mellow note he had.
But who was Morton, to call for the murderer?</p>

<p>Paris, after spying again, said that they were going to
fire the doors; and added, ‘Master, it is hot enough without
a fire. We had best be off.’</p>

<p>Bothwell looked at the Queen. ‘My dear, I must go.’</p>

<p>She barely turned her eyes upon him; but she said,
‘Do you leave me here?’ Scathing question from a
bride, had a man been able to observe such things.</p>

<p>He said, ‘Ay, I do. It is me they want, these dogs.
You will be safe if they know that I am away—and I will
take care they do know it. I go to Dunbar, whence you
shall hear from me by some means. Crookstone, come
you with me, and come you, Hobbie. Paris, you stay
here.’</p>

<p>‘Pardon, master,’ says Paris, ‘I go with your lordship.’</p>

<p>Pale Paris was measured with his eye. ‘I’ll kill you if
you do, my fine man.’</p>

<p>‘That is your lordship’s affair,’ says Paris with deference;
‘but first I will show you the way out. There are horses
in the undercroft.’</p>

<p>Bothwell lifted up his wife, held her in his arms and
kissed her twice. ‘Fie, you are cold!’ he said, and put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
her down. She had lain listless against him, without
kissing.</p>

<p>He turned at once and followed Paris; young Crookstone
followed him. It seems that he got clear off in the
way he intended, for the noises outside the house ceased;
and in the grey of the morning, before three o’clock, all
was quiet about the policies. They must have been within
an ace of capturing him: in fact, Paris admitted afterwards
that they were but a bowshot away at one time.</p>

<p class="tb">The Queen sent Seton for Des-Essars at about four
o’clock in the morning. Neither mistress nor maid had
been to bed.</p>

<p>He found her in a high fever; her eyes glowing like jet,
her face white and pinched; the stroke of her certain fate
drawing down her mouth. She said, ‘I have been a false
woman, a coward, and a shame to my race.’</p>

<p>‘God knows your Majesty is none of these.’</p>

<p>‘Baptist, I am going to my lord.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, madam, God forbid you!’</p>

<p>‘God will forbid me presently if I do not. It should
have been last night—I may be too late. But make
haste.’</p>

<p>They procured a guide of a sort, a wretched poltroon of
a fellow, who twice tried to run for it and leave them in
Yester woods. Des-Essars, after the second attempt, rode
beside him with a cocked pistol in his hand. From Yester
they went north by Haddington, for fear of Whittingehame
and the Douglases. As it was, they had to skirt
Lethington, and the Secretary’s fine grey house there in
the park; but the place was close-barred—nothing hindered
them. They passed unknown through Haddington, the
Queen desperately tired. Sixteen hours in the saddle, a
cold welcome at the end.</p>

<p>Bothwell received them without cheer. ‘You would
have been wiser to have stayed. Here you are in the
midst of war.’</p>

<p>‘My place was by your side.’</p>

<p>The mockery of the thing struck him all at once. This
schemed-for life of his—a vast, empty shell of a house!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Oh, God, I sicken of this folly!’ He turned from
her.</p>

<p>She had nothing to say, could hardly stand on her feet.
Seton took her to bed.</p>

<p>A message next day from Huntly in Edinburgh.
Balfour held the castle; all the rest of the town was
Grange’s. Morton, Atholl, and Lethington were rulers.
Atholl had Holyroodhouse; Lethington and his wife were
with Morton. He himself, said Huntly, would move out
in a day or two and join the Hamiltons at Dalkeith.
Let Bothwell raise the Merse and meet them.
He named Gladsmuir for rendezvous, on the straight
road from Haddington to the city, five miles by west of
Haddington.</p>

<p>Bothwell read all this to the Queen, who said nothing.
She was thinking of a business of her own, as appeared
when she was alone. She beckoned up Baptist.</p>

<p>‘There’s not a moment to be lost. Find me a messenger,
a trusty one, who will get speech with Mary
Fleming.’</p>

<p>‘Madam,’ says Baptist, ‘let me go.’</p>

<p>‘No, no: I need you. Try Paris—no! my lord would
never spare him. And he would deny me again. Do you
choose somebody.’</p>

<p>‘What is he to say to her, ma’am?’</p>

<p>‘He shall speak to her in private. She knows where
my coffer is—my casket.’</p>

<p>Ah! this was a grave affair. Des-Essars made up his
mind at once. ‘Madam,’ he said, ‘let me advise your
Majesty. Either send me, or send no one. If you send
me I will bring the casket back. That I promise. If
you send no one—if you do not remind her—it will slip
her memory.’</p>

<p>The Queen’s eyes showed her fears. ‘Remember you,
Baptist, of my casket. If Fleming were to betray me to
Lethington——’ No need to end.</p>

<p>‘Again I say, madam, send me.’</p>

<p>She thought; but even so her eyes filled with tears,
which began to fall fast.</p>

<p>‘Dearest madam, do you weep?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I cannot let you go. Do not ask me—I need you
here.’</p>

<p>He leaned to her. ‘Alas, what can I do to help your
Majesty?’</p>

<p>She took his hand. ‘Stay. You are my only friend.
The end is not far. Have a little patience—stay.’</p>

<p>‘But your casket——’</p>

<p>She shook her head. ‘Let all go now. Stay you
with me.’</p>

<p>‘Certainly I will stay with you,’ he said. ‘It will be to
see you triumph over your enemies.’</p>

<p>And again she shook her head. ‘Not with a broken
heart!’ Then in a frightened whisper she began to tell
him her fears. ‘Do you know what they make ready for
me? The stake, and the faggot, and the fire! Fire for
the wife that slew her husband. Baptist, you will never
forsake me now! This is my secret knowledge. Never
forsake me!’ She hid her face on his shoulder and cried
there, as one lost.</p>

<p>Bothwell burst into the room: they sprang apart. He
was eager, flush with news. ‘We march to-morrow with
the light. My men are coming in—in good order. Be
of good cheer, madam, for with God’s help we shall pound
these knaves properly.’</p>

<p>‘How shall God help us, my lord,’ said she, ‘who have
helped not Him?’</p>

<p>‘Why, then, my dear,’ cries he with a laugh, ‘why,
then, we will help ourselves.’</p>

<h3 id="III_CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="smaller">APPASSIONATA</span></h3>

<p>Grange, that fine commander, got his back to the sun
and gave the lords the morning advantage. ‘We shall
want no more than that,’ he told Morton; ‘by ten o’clock
they will be here, and by noon we shall be through with it.’</p>

<p>‘Shall we out banner, think you?’ says Morton.</p>

<p>‘Nay, my lord, nay. Keep her back the now.’ Grange
was fighting with his head, disposing his host according to
the lie of the ground, and his reserves also. He took the
field before dawn, and had every man at his post by seven
o’clock. There was a ground mist, and the sea all blotted
out: everything promised great heat.</p>

<p>They were to be seen, a waiting host, when the Queen
crested Carbery Hill and watched her men creep round
about; with Erskine beside her she could make them out—arquebusiers,
pikemen, and Murrays from Atholl on the
lowest ground (Tillibardine leading them), on either wing
horsemen with spears. They had a couple of brass field-pieces
in front. One could see the chiefs walking their
horses up and down the lines, or pricking forward to confer,
or clustering together, looking to where one pointed with
his staff. There was Morton on his white horse, himself,
portly man, in black with a steel breastplate—white sash
across it—in his steel bonnet a favour of white. White
was their badge, then; for, looking at them in the mass,
the host was seen to be spattered with it, as if in a neglected
field of poppies and corncockles there grew white daisies
interspersed. The stout square man in leather jerkin and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
buff boots was Grange—on a chestnut horse; with him to
their right rode Atholl on a black—Atholl in a red surtout,
and the end of his fine beard lost in the white sash which
he too had. Who is the slim rider in black—haunting
Atholl like a shadow? Who but careful Mr. Secretary
Lethington could have those obsequious shoulders, that
attentive cock of the head? Lethington was there, then!
Ah! and there, by one’s soul, was Archie Douglas’s grey
young head, and his white minister’s ruff, where a red
thread of blood ought to be. Glencairn was there, Lindsay,
Sempill, Rothes—all those strong tradesmen, who had lied
for their profit, and were now come to claim wages: all of
them but the trader of traders, the white-handed prayerful
man, the good Earl of Moray, safe in France, waiting his
turn.</p>

<p>So prompt as they stood down there in the grey haze, all
rippling in the heat; without sound of trumpet or any noise
but the whinnying of a horse; without any motion save
now and then, when some trooper plunged out of line and
must pull back—that thing of all significant things about
them was marked by the Queen, who stood shading her
eyes from the sun atop of Carbery Hill. ‘Oh, Erskine!’
she said, ‘oh, Bothwell! they have no standard. Against
whom, then, do we fight?’</p>

<p>Bothwell, exasperated by anxiety, made short answer:
‘It is plain enough to see what and who they are. They
are men—desperate men. They are men for whom loss
means infamous death. For, mark you well, madam, if
Morton lose this day he loses his head.’</p>

<p>‘Ay,’ she gloomed, ‘and many more shall lose theirs. I
will have Lindsay’s and Archie’s—and you shall have
Lethington’s.’</p>

<p>‘I would have had that long ago, if you had listened to
me. And now you see whether I was right or wrong. But
when women take to ruling men——’</p>

<p>She touched his arm. ‘Dear friend, for whom I have
suffered many things, do not reproach me at this hour.’
The tears were in her eyes—she was always quick at
self-pity.</p>

<p>But he had turned his head. ‘Ha! they need me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
I see. Forgive me, madam, I must have a word with
Ormiston.’ He saluted and rode down to meet his allies.
Monsieur Du Croc, the French Ambassador, approached
her, hat in hand. He was full of sympathy; but, with his
own theories of how to end this business, could not give
advice.</p>

<p>Sir James Melvill, watching the men come up, shook his
head at the look of them. ‘No heart in their chance—no
heart at all,’ he was heard to say.</p>

<p>The Queen’s forces deployed across the eastern face of
Carbery Hill in a long line which, it was clear, was not of
equal strength with the lords’. It became less so as the
day wore; for had you looked to its right you would have
seen a continual trickle of stooping, running men crossing
over to the enemy. These were deserters at the eleventh
hour; Bothwell rode one of them down, chased him, and
when he fell drove his horse over him and over in a blind
fury of rage, trampling him out of semblance to his kind.
It stayed the leak for a while; but it began again, and he
had neither heart nor time to deal with it. Where were
the Hamiltons who should have been with her? Where,
alas, were the Gordons? In place of them the Borderers
and Foresters looked shaggy thieves—gypsies, hill-robbers,
savage men, red-haired, glum-faced, many without shoes
and some without breeches. The tressured Lion of Scotland
was in Arthur Erskine’s hold: at near ten o’clock
Bothwell bade him display it. It unfurled itself lazily its
full length; but there was no breath of air. It clung about
the staff like so much water-weed; and they never saw the
Lion. No matter; it would be a sign to that watchful host
in the plain: now let us see what flag they dare to fly.
They waited tensely for it, a group of them together—the
Queen with her wild tawny hair fallen loose, her bare thin
neck, her short red petticoat and blue scarf; Bothwell
biting his tongue; Ormiston, Des-Essars, sage Monsieur
Du Croc.</p>

<p>They saw two men come out of the line bearing two spears
close together. At a word they separated, backing from
each other: a great white sheet was displayed, having some
picture upon it—green, a blot like blood, a wavy legend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
above. One could make out a tree; but what was the red
stain? They talked—the Queen very fast and excitedly.
She must know what this was—she would go down and
find out—it was some insult, she expected. Was that red
a fire? Who would go? Des-Essars offered, but she
refused him. She chose Lord Livingstone for the service,
and he went, gallantly enough—and returned, a scared old
optimist indeed. However, she would have it, so she
learned that they had the King lying dead under a tree, and
the Prince his son praying at his feet—with the legend,
‘Judge and avenge my cause, O Lord!’ The red was
not a fire, but the Prince’s robe. The Queen cried out:
‘Infamy! Infamy! They carry their own condemnation—do
you not see it?’ If anybody did, he did not say so.</p>

<p class="tb">Monsieur Du Croc had his way at last, and was allowed
to carry messages between the hosts. The burden of all
that he brought back was that the lords would obey the
Queen if she would give up the murderers, whom they
named. The offer was ludicrous, coming from Morton—but
when she ordered Du Croc back to expose it, he fairly
told her to read below the words. They had come for
Lord Bothwell. ‘I will die sooner than let him be
touched,’ said she. ‘Let some one—Hob Ormiston, go
you—fetch Grange to speak with me.’ Hob went off,
with a white scarf in his held-up hand; and the Queen
rode half-way down the hill for the parley. The great
banner dazzled her: it was noticed that she bent her head
down, as one rides against the sun.</p>

<p>Grange came leisurely up towards her—a rusty man of
war, shrewd, terse, and weathered. He could only report
what his masters bade him: they called for the surrender
of the murderers. She flamed and faced him with her
royal anger. ‘And I, your sovereign lady, bid you,
Grange, go over there and bring the murderers to me.
Look, there goes one on his white horse! And there
shirk two after him, hiding behind him—the one with a
grey head, and the other with a grey face. Fetch you me
those.’</p>

<p>‘Bah!’ snarled Bothwell, ‘we talk for ever. Let me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
shoot down this dog.’ A Hepburn—quiet and sinewy—stepped
out of the ranks with a horse-pistol. Grange
watched him without moving a muscle; but ‘Oh!’ cried
the Queen, ‘what villainy are you about?’ She struck
down the pistol-arm,—as once before she had struck down
Fawdonsyde’s.</p>

<p>Bothwell, red in the face, said, ‘Let us end this folly.
Let him who calls for me come and fetch me. I will fight
with him here and now. Go you, Grange, and bring my
Lord Morton hither.’</p>

<p>‘No need for his lordship, if I will serve your turn, Earl
of Bothwell,’ says Grange.</p>

<p>But Bothwell said, ‘Damn your soul, I fight with my
equals. None knows it better than you.’ He would have
no one below an Earl’s rank—himself being now, you
must recollect, Duke of Orkney and Zetland—and it
should be Morton for choice.</p>

<p>Grange, instructed by the Queen, rode back. They
saw Morton accost him, listen, look over the valley. He
called a conference—they talked vehemently: then Morton
and Lindsay pricked forward up the hill, and stopped
within hailing distance.</p>

<p>‘You, Bothwell,’ cried Morton, ‘come you down, then;
and have at you here.’</p>

<p>The Queen’s high voice called clearly back. ‘He shall
never fight with you, murderer.’</p>

<p>Lindsay bared his head. ‘Then let him take me,
madam; for I am nothing of that sort.’</p>

<p>‘No, no, Lindsay,’ said Bothwell; ‘I have no quarrel
with you.’</p>

<p>The Earl of Morton had been looking at Bothwell in
his heavy, ruminating way, as if making up his mind.
While the others were bandying their cries, the Queen’s
voice flashing and shrieking above the rest, he still looked
and turned his thoughts over. Presently—in his time—he
gave Lindsay his sword and walked his horse up the
hill to the Queen’s party. He saluted her gravely. ‘With
your gracious leave, madam, I seek to put two words into
my Lord Bothwell’s ear. You see I have no sword.’</p>

<p>The Queen looked at once to her husband. He nodded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
gave his sword to Huntly, and said, ‘I am ready for you.’
They moved ten yards apart; Morton talked and the other
listened.</p>

<p>‘Bothwell, my man,’ he said, ‘there’s no a muckle to
pick between us, I doubt—I played one card and you
another; but I have the advantage of ye just now, and
am no that minded to take it up. Man!’ he chuckled,
‘ye stumbled sorely when ye let them find for the
powder!’</p>

<p>‘Get on, get on,’ says Bothwell, drawing a great breath.</p>

<p>‘I will,’ Morton said. ‘I am here to advise ye to make
off while you can. Go your ways to Dunbar, and avoid
the country for a while. I’ll warrant you you’ll not be
followed oversea. All my people will serve the Queen—have
no fear for her. Now, take my advice; ’tis fairly
given. I’ve no wish to work you a mischief—though,
mind you, I have the power—for you and I have been
open dealers with each other this long time. And you
brought me home—I’m not one to forget it. But—Lord
of Hosts! what chance have you against Grange?’ He
waited. ‘Come now, come! what say you?’</p>

<p>Lord Bothwell considered it, working his strong jaw
from side to side: a fair proffer, an honourable proffer.
He looked at the forces against him—though he had no
need; he knew them better men than his, because Grange
was a better man than he. That banner of murder—the
cry behind it—the Prince behind the cry, up on the rock
of Stirling: in his heart he knew that he had lost the
game. No way to Stirling—no way! But the other way
was the sea-way—the old free life, the chances of the open
water. Eh, damn them, he was not to be King of Scots,
then! But he had known that for a week. He turned
his head and saw the sea like molten gold, and far off,
dipped in it, a little ship with still sails—Ho! the
sea-way!</p>

<p>‘By God, Morton,’ he said, ‘you may be serving me.
I’ll do it.’</p>

<p>‘Go and tell her,’ says Morton; and they both went
back to the Queen.</p>

<p>Both took off their bonnets. Bothwell said: ‘Madam,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
we must avoid blood-shedding if we may, and I have talked
with my lord of Morton. He makes an offer of fair dealing,
which I have taken. I have a clear road to Dunbar, thence
where I will. All these hosts will follow you if I am not
there. They pay me the compliment of high distrust, you
perceive. After a little, I doubt not but you shall see me
back again where I would always be. Madam, get the
Prince in your own hands: all depends upon him. And
now, kiss me, sweetheart, for I must be away.’</p>

<p>She heard him—she understood him—she believed him.
She was curious to observe that she felt so little. Her
voice when she answered him had no spring in it—it was
worn and thin, with a little grating rasp in it—an older
voice.</p>

<p>‘It may be better so. I hate to shed good blood.
Whither shall I write to you? At Dunbar? In England?
Flanders?’ There had been a woman in Dunkirk—she
remembered that.</p>

<p>He was looking away, answering at random, searching
whom he should take with him, or on whom he could
reckon to follow him if he asked. ‘I will send you word.
Yes, yes, you will write to me. You shall know full soon.
But now I cannot stay.’</p>

<p>Morton had returned to his friends.</p>

<p>‘Paris, come you with me. Ormiston, are you for the
sea? No? Stay and be hanged, then. Hob? What,
man, afraid? Where is Michael Elliott? Where is
Crookstone? What Hepburn have I?’ He collected
six or eight—both the Ormistons decided for him—Powrie
and Wilson, Dalgleish, one or two more.</p>

<p>He took the Queen’s hand gaily. ‘Farewell, fair
Queen!’ he said; and she, ‘Adieu, my lord.’ He leaned
towards her: ‘One kiss, my wife!’ but she drew back.
‘Your lips are foul—you have kissed too many—no, no.’
‘I must have it—you must kiss me’—he pressed against
her. For a while she was agitated, defending herself; but
then, with a sob, ‘Ay, take what you will of me,’ she said—‘it
is little worth.’ He got his cold kiss, and rode fast
through his scattering host. This going of his was the
Parthian shot. He had beaten her. Desire was dead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span></p>

<p>The Queen sat still—with a face like a rock. ‘Has he
gone?’ she asked Des-Essars in a whisper.</p>

<p>‘Yes, thank God,’ said he.</p>

<p>She shook herself into action, gathered up the reins, and
turned to Erskine. ‘Come,’ she said, ‘we will go down to
them now.’</p>

<p>She surrendered to the Earl of Atholl, who, with Sempill
and Lindsay, came up to fetch her. Followed by one or
two of her friends—Des-Essars, Melvill, Du Croc, and
Livingstone—she rode down the hill from her host and
joined the other. Grange cantered up, bareheaded, to meet
her, reined up short, took her hand and kissed it. Many
followed him—Glencairn, Glamis, young Ruthven. Each
had his kiss; but then came Archie Douglas smelling and
smiling for his—and got nothing. She drew back from
him shuddering: he might have been a snake, he said.
Lethington was not to be seen. The host stood at ease
awaiting her; the white banner wagged and dipped, as if
mocking her presence. ‘Take that down,’ she said, with a
crack in her dry throat; but no one answered her. She
had to go close by the hateful thing—a daub of red and
green and yellow—crowned Darnley crudely lying under a
tree, a crowned child kneeling at his feet, spewing the
legend out of his mouth. She averted her eyes and blinked
as she passed it: an ominous silence greeted her, sullen
looks; one or two steady starers showed scornful familiarity
with ‘a woman in trouble’; one said ‘Losh!’ and spat as
she passed.</p>

<p>She was led through the Murrays, Humes, and Lindsays;
murmurs gathered about her; all eyes were on her now,
some passionate, some vindictive, some fanatic. On a
sudden a pikeman ran out of his ranks and pointed at
her—his face was burnt almost black, his eyes showed
white upon it. ‘Burn the hure!’ he raved, and when she
caught her breath and gazed at him, he was answered, ‘Ay,
ay, man. Let her burn herself clean. To the fire with
her!’</p>

<p>Her fine heart stood still. ‘Oh!’ she said, shocked into
childish utterance, ‘oh, Baptist, they speak of me. They
will burn me—did you hear them?’ Her head was thrown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
back, her arm across her face. She broke into wild sobbing—‘Not
the fire! Not the fire! Oh, pity me! Oh, keep
me from them!’</p>

<p>‘Quick, man,’ said Atholl, ‘let us get her in.’ Orders
were shortly given, lieutenants galloped left and right to
carry the words. The companies formed; the monstrous
banner turned about. Morton bade sound the advance;
between him and Atholl she was led towards Edinburgh.
‘If Erskine is a man he will try a rescue,’ thought
Des-Essars, and looked over his shoulder to Carbery Hill—now
a bare brae. The Queen’s army had vanished like
the smoke.</p>

<p>So towards evening they came to town, heralded by
scampering messengers, and met by the creatures of the
suburb, horrible women and the men who lived upon them—dancing
about her, mocking obscenely, hailing her as a
spectacle. She bowed her head, swaying about in the
saddle. Way was driven through; they passed under the
gates, and began to climb the long street, packed from wall
to wall with raving, cursing people. They shook their fists
at her, threw their bonnets; stones flew about—she might
have been killed outright. The cries were terrible—‘Burn
her, burn her! Nay, let her drown, the witch!’ Dust,
heat, turmoil, a brown fetid air, hatred and clamour—the
houses seemed to whirl and dizzy about her. The earth
rocked; the people, glued in masses of black and white,
surged stiffly, like great sea waves. Pale as death, with
shut eyes and moving, dumb lips, she wavered on her seat,
held up on either side by a man’s arm. Des-Essars prayed
aloud that a stone might strike her dead.</p>

<p>They took her to a house by the Tron Church, a house
in the High Street, and shut her in an upper room, setting
a guard about the door. The white banner was planted
before the windows, and the crowd swarmed all about it,
shrieking her name, calling her to come out and dance
before them. Her dancing was notorious, poor soul;
many a mad bout had she had in her careless days.
‘Show your legs, my bonnie wife!’ cried some hoarse
shoemaker. ‘You had no shame to do it syne.’ This
lasted till near midnight—for when it grew dark torches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
were kindled from end to end of the street, drums and
pipes were set going, and many a couple danced. The
Queen during this hellish night was crouched upon the
floor, hiding her face upon Mary Seton’s bosom. Des-Essars
knelt by her, screening her from the windows.
She neither spoke nor wept—seemed in a stupor. Food
was brought her, but she would not move to take it; nor
would she open her mouth when the cup was held at her
lips.</p>

<p>Next morning, having had a few hours’ peace, the
tumult began betimes—by six o’clock the din was deafening.
She had had a sop in wine, and was calmer; talked
a little, even peeped through the curtain at the gathering
crowd. She watched it for, perhaps, an hour, until they
brought the mermaid picture into action—herself naked to
the waist, with a fish-tail—confronted it with the murder
flag, and jigged it up against it. This angered her; colour
burned in her white cheeks. ‘Infamous! Swine that they
are! I will brave them all.’</p>

<p>Before they could stop her she had thrown open the
window, and stood outside on the balcony, proudly surveying
and surveyed.</p>

<p>At first there was a hush—‘Whisht! She will likely
speak till us,’ they told each other. But she said nothing,
and gave them time to mark her tumbled bodice and short
kirtle, her wild hair and stained face. They howled at
her, mocking and gibing at her—the two banners flacked
like tailless kites. Presently a horseman came at a foot’s
pace through the press. The rider when he saw her pulled
his hat down over his eyes—but it was too late. She had
seen Lethington. ‘Ha, traitor, whose rat-life I saved
once,’ she called out, in a voice desperately clear and cold,
‘are you come to join your friends against me? Stay,
Mr. Secretary, and greet your Queen in the way they will
teach you. Or go, fetch your wife, that she may thank
her benefactress with you. Do you go, Mr. Secretary?’</p>

<p>He was, in fact, going; for the crowd had turned
against him and was bidding him fetch his wife. ‘Give
us the Popish Maries together, sir, and we’ll redd Scotland
of them a’.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Rid Scotland of this fellow, good people,’ cried the
Queen, ‘and there will be room for one honest man.’</p>

<p>They jeered at her for her pains. ‘Who shall be honest
where ye are, woman? Hide yourself—pray to your idols—that
they keep ye from the fire.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, men, you do me wrong,’ she began to moan.
‘Oh, sirs, be pitiful to a woman. Have I ever harmed
any?’</p>

<p>They shrieked her down, cursing her for a witch and a
husband-killer. The flags were jigged together again—a
stone broke the window over her head. Des-Essars then
got her back by force.</p>

<p>It is amazing that she could have a thought in such a
riot of fiends—yet the sight of Lethington had given her
one. She feared his grey, rat’s face. She whispered it to
Des-Essars. ‘Baptist, you can save me. Quick, for the
love of Christ! The coffer! the coffer!’</p>

<p>He knew what she meant. That coffer contained her
letters to Bothwell, her sonnets—therefore, her life. He
understood her, and went away without a word. He took
his sword, put a hood over his head, got out of the backside
of the house, over a wall, into the wynd. Hence, being
perfectly unknown, he entered the crowd in the High
Street and worked his way down the Canongate. He
intended to get into Holyroodhouse by the wall and the
kitchen window, as he had done many a time, and notably
on the night of David’s slaughter.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p class="tb">Des-Essars had gone to save her life; but whether he
did it or no, he did not come back. She wore herself to
thread, padding up and down the room, wondering and
fretting about him. This new anxiety made her forget the
street; but towards evening, when her nerves were frayed
and raw, it began to infuriate her—as an incessant cry
always will. She suddenly began panting, and stood holding
her breasts, staring, moving her lips, her bosom heaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
in spite of her hands. ‘God! Mother of God! Aid me:
I go mad,’ she cried, strangling, and ‘Air! I suffocate!’
and once more threw open the windows and let in the
hubbub.</p>

<p>She was really tormented for air and breath. She tore
at her bodice, split it open and showed herself naked to the
middle.</p>

<p>‘Yes—yes—you shall look upon me as I was made. You
shall see that I am a woman—loved once—loved much.
See, see, my flesh!’ Horrible scandal!—but the poor soul
was mad.</p>

<p>Soon after this some of the lords came to her—Lindsay,
Morton, and Atholl. The windows, they said, must be
closed at once; they feared a riot. They would take her
back to Holyroodhouse if she would be patient. But she
must be rendered decent: Atholl gave her his cloak. She
had quieted immediately they came, and thanked them
meekly.</p>

<p>They took her away at once. Mary Seton followed
close, but was gently pushed back by Lord Morton. ‘No,
no: she must come alone. You shall see her after a little.
You cannot come now.’ For the first time in her life, as I
believe, Mary Seton shed tears.</p>

<p>A very strong guard, with pikes presented, hedged her
in. She reached Holyrood on foot, and was shut into her
own cabinet. It was empty and dark but for the candle
they had left with her. She snatched it up, and began a
mad, fruitless hunt for her casket. It was not in its place—it
was nowhere. She hunted until she dropped. She
began to tear at herself and to shriek. Doom! Doom!
She must be burned. They had taken her coffer. She was
alone—condemned and alone.</p>

<p>Then Des-Essars crawled out of the dark on his hands
and one knee, dragging a broken leg after him, and fell
close beside her, and kissed the hem of her petticoat.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_12" id="Footnote_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> The casket, which was not at Holyrood, is supposed to have been secured
by Bothwell in the Castle, where it was to be found in due time. But Des-Essars
did not know that. Nor is it clear to me how Bothwell had found
opportunity to get it there.</p>

<span class="smaller">ADDOLORATA</span></h3>

<p>She sat on the floor, and had his head at rest on her lap.
Her hands were upon him, and so he rested. The great
tears fell fast and wetted his hair.</p>

<p>Her grief was silent and altogether gentle. Still as she
sat there, looking before her with wide unwinking eyes and
lips a little parted, she was unconscious of what she was
suffering or had suffered: all about her was the blankness
of dark, and without her knowledge the night fell; the
dusk like a vast cloak gathered round about her, fold over
fold; and still she sat and looked at nothing with her wide
unwinking eyes. Slowly they filled and brimmed, and
slowly the great tears, as they ripened, fell. There were
no other forms of grief, none of grief’s high acts: only their
bitter symbol—lamentation embodied in tears, and nakedly
there.</p>

<p>‘Nay, move not your hands—nay, touch my brows:
my head aches—I am blind.’ The lad supine in her lap
pleaded in whispers.</p>

<p>Gentle-voiced she answered him. ‘There is no work
left for my hands to do but to tend thee, my dear.’</p>

<p>He lay dumb for a while; then said he: ‘You shall not
blame me. It is not here—not in the house. I know
not where it is. They are seeking it now. He came here
with two archers. He snarled like a fox to find me.’</p>

<p>‘Who was this, Baptist? Was it Lethington?’</p>

<p>‘Lethington. He believed it was here. He forced that
knowledge from his wife——’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span></p>

<p>She said, ‘Fleming too?’</p>

<p>‘——I fought. They tried to make me tell them where
I had hid it. They lifted and threw me. I am hurt—cannot
move. Oh, they will have it now.’</p>

<p>‘Rest, my dear, rest. Think no more of it. They have
all but me.’ Out of the heart of this poor nameless youth
she was to learn good love; but to learn it only to know
its impossibility. Not for her now, not for her! Not so
could she ever have loved; no! but she could be kind.
She stooped her head over him and breathed softly
through the dark—‘and I, Baptist, am yours if you
will.’</p>

<p>He sighed. ‘Oh, that it were possible! That night
when you looked back—that night——you let me take——remember
you of that?’</p>

<p>She knew his thought and all his heart. Her own
were at leagues of distance: but she could not now refuse
him kindness. She stooped her head lower towards his,
and whispered, ‘Baptist, can you hear me?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, yes.’</p>

<p>‘My last gift—all I have left: yours by right. Do you
hear me? Listen—understand. I am yours now—I am
forsaken by all but you.’</p>

<p>He moved uneasily, sighed again. ‘Too late, too late:
I lie dying here.’</p>

<p>She leaned down yet nearer; he felt her warm breath
beat upon him—quick and short and eager. ‘If I die this
night, and if thou die, I will love thee first.’</p>

<p>‘Ah!’ said he, ‘I know very well that you desire to love
me now.’</p>

<p>‘How knowest thou, my love?’</p>

<p>‘By the way you lean to me, and by other things.’</p>

<p>She said, ‘You are well schooled in love.’</p>

<p>‘Not so well,’ he answered; ‘but I am well schooled in
you, my Queen.’</p>

<p>‘Prove me, then—desire of me—ask—take. I shall
never deny thee anything.’</p>

<p>Again he said, ‘Too late, too late. You cannot—and I
lie dying. Yet, since the dead can do you no wrong, let
me lie here at rest, that I may die loving you.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span></p>

<p>She stooped to kiss him. She anointed him with her
hot tears. ‘Rest, rest, my only true lover!’</p>

<p>‘Peace,’ said he: ‘let me sleep. I am tired to death.’</p>

<p>She kissed his eyelids. He slept.</p>

<p class="tb">Men came about the door—more than one. She sprang
from her mate and kneeled to face that way, screening him
where he lay short-breathing. They knocked, then opened.
The torchlight beat upon her, and showed her dishevelled
and undone. She covered her bosom with her crossed
arms. ‘What is it? Who comes?’</p>

<p>‘Madam’—this was Lord Lindsay—‘it is I. I have
horses beyond the wall. It is time to be going. You and
I must take the road.’</p>

<p>‘Whither, sir? Whither will you take me so late?’</p>

<p>‘To Lochleven, ma’am.’</p>

<p>‘You order me? By whose warrant?’</p>

<p>‘By the Council’s. In the name of the Prince.’</p>

<p>‘It is infamy that you do. I cannot go. I am alone
here.’</p>

<p>‘Women, clothing, all, shall follow with good speed,
madam. But we must be speedier.’</p>

<p>‘If I refuse you—if I command——?’</p>

<p>‘I cannot consider with your Majesty the effect of that.’</p>

<p>‘Do you take me, Lindsay—you alone? No, but I will
die here sooner.’</p>

<p>Lord Sempill spoke. ‘I offer myself to your Majesty,
with the consent of the Lords.’</p>

<p>She rose up then. ‘I thank you, Lord Sempill: I will
go with you.’</p>

<p>She gave him her hand, which, having kissed, he held.
He would have taken her away then and there, but that she
pulled against him. ‘I leave my servant dead here. He
loved me well, and I him. Let me pray a while; then I
will go.’</p>

<p>Des-Essars turned and rose to his arm’s length from the
ground. He could not move his legs. ‘I am a prisoner
also—take me.’</p>

<p>‘You, my man?’ says Lindsay: ‘unlikely.’</p>

<p>She withdrew her hand from Sempill’s by leave, stooped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
over the fading lad and kissed his eyes. ‘Adieu, my truest
love and last friend—adieu, adieu! I have been death to
all who have had to do with me.’ She kissed him once
more.</p>

<p>‘Sweet death,’ said Des-Essars.</p>

<p>‘Come,’ she said to Lord Sempill, and gave him her
hand again. He led her away.</p>

<p>Des-Essars fell his length upon the floor. She would
have turned back to him; they hurried her forward between
them.</p>

<p>The door shut upon Queen Mary.</p>

<h2 id="EPILOGUE">EPILOGUE<br />
<span class="smaller">WHEREIN WE HAVE A GREAT MAN GREATLY MOVED</span></h2>

<p>It is said that when the Earl of Moray, in France, received
from the messengers sent out to him the news that he was
chosen Regent of Scotland, he bowed his head in a very
stately manner and said little more than ‘Sirs, I shall strive
in this as in all things to do the Lord’s will.’ He added
not one word which might enhance or impair so proper a
declaration; he remained invisible to his friends for the
three or four days he needed to be abroad; and when he
set out for the north, travelled in secret and mostly by
night—and still chose to keep apart. As secret in his hour
of success as he had been in those of defeat, admirable as
his sobriety may be, we must make allowances for the
mortification of a learned man, Mr. George Buchanan, who,
having laboured to be of the heralding party, found himself
and his baggage of odes of no more account than any other
body. Was the chilly piety of such a reception as my lord
had vouchsafed them all the acknowledgment he cared to
admit of ancient alliances, of sufferings shared, of hopes
kept alive by mutual fostering? Could a man look forward
to any community of mind in the future between a prince
who would not recognise his old friends and those same tried
friends frozen by such a blank reply to their embassage?
Mr. Buchanan urged these questions upon his fellow-legate,
Sir James Melvill of Halhill—a traveller and fine philosopher,
who, with less latinity than the learned historian, had, I
think, more phlegm. When Mr. Buchanan, fretfully exclaiming
upon the isolation of his new master, went on to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
concern himself with poor Scotland’s case, and to muse
aloud upon Kings Log and Stork, Sir James twiddled his
thumbs; when the humanist paused for a reply, he got it.
‘Geordie, my man,’ said Sir James, ‘my counsel to you is
to bide your good time, and when that time comes to ca’
canny, as we have it familiarly. Remember you, that when
you sang your bit epithalamy at the marriage-door of Log,
our late King, although he never stinted his largess (but
rewarded you, in my opinion, abundantly), he had no notion
in the world what you were about, and (as I believe) paid
you the more that you might end the sooner. Late or soon
you will be heard by our new gracious lord, and late or soon
recompensed. He too will desire you to stop, my man:
not because he does not understand you, but because he
understands you too well. Mark my words now.’ This
was a curious prophecy of Sir James’s, in one sense
curiously fulfilled. In the very middle of his oration the
orator was desired to stop by the subject of it.</p>

<p>Not until the Regent was in Edinburgh did a chance
present itself to Mr. Buchanan of declaiming any of his
Latin. This, be it said, was no fault of Mr. Buchanan’s,
who, if abhorrence of the old order and acceptance of the
new, expressed with passion at all times of the day, can
entitle a man to notice, should certainly have had it before.
Some, indeed, think that he got it by insisting upon having
it; others that he proved his title by exhibiting the heads
of a remarkable work which afterwards made some stir in
the world: he was, at any rate, summoned to the Castle,
and in the presence of the Lord Regent of Scotland, of the
Lords Morton, Crawfurd, Atholl, Argyll, and Lindsay, of
the Lairds of Grange and Lethington, and of others too
numerous to mention, was allowed to deliver himself of an
oration, long meditated, in the Ciceronian manner.</p>

<p>The occasion was weighty, the theme worthy, the orator
equal. <i>Tantæ molis erat</i> was the burden of his discourse,
wherein the late miseries of God’s people were shown
clearly to be, as it were, the travail-pangs of the august
mother of new-born Scotland. From these, by a series of
circuits which it would be long to follow, he passed to
consider the Hero of the hour; and you may be sure that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>
the extraordinary dignity and reserve which this personage
had recently shown were not forgotten. They were, said
the orator, <i>reasonable</i>, not only as coming from a man who
had never failed of humility before God, but as crowning a
life-long trial of such qualities. The child is father of the
man. Who that had ever known this magnanimous prince
had seen him otherwise than remote, alone in contemplation,
<i>unspotted from the world</i>? In a peroration which
was so finely eloquent that enthusiasm broke in upon it
and prevented it from ever being finished, he spoke to this
effect:—</p>

<p>‘It is furthermore,’ he said, ‘a singular merit of your
lordship’s, in these days of brawl and advertisement, that
you have always approved, and still do approve yourself
one who, like the nightingale (that choice bird), avoids the
multitude, but enriches it, <i>quasi</i> out of the dark. For as
the little songster in his plain suit of brown, hardly to be
seen in the twiggy brake, pours forth his notes upon the
wayfarer; so has your lordship, hiding from the painful
dusty mart, ravished the traffickers therein to better things
by your most melodious, half-hidden deeds. O coy benefactor
of Scotland! O reluctantly a king! O hermit Hercules!
O thou doer-of-good-by-stealth!’ Here he turned
to the Lords of the Privy Council. ‘Conscript Fathers,
we have prevailed upon our Cincinnatus to quit his
plough lest haply the State had perished; but with him
have come to succour us those virtues which are his
peculiar—to which, no less than to those which he hath
in community with all saviours of Commonwealths, our
extreme tribute is due. Let us respect Austerity whenas
we find it, respect True Religion, respect Abnegation, respect,
above all, the tender feelings of Blood and Family,
lacerated (alas!) of late in a princely bosom. Great
and altogether lovely are these things in any man: in
a statesman how much the more dear in that they are
rare! But a greater thing than austerity and the crown
of true religion is this, Conscript Fathers, that a man
should live through blood-shedding, and <i>not see it</i>; that
he should converse with bloody men, and <i>keep clean
hands</i>! For King David said, “I will wash my hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
in innocency,” and said well, having some need of the
ablution. Conscript Fathers! this man hath the rather
said, “But I will keep my hands innocently clean, lest at
any time lustral water fail me and I perish.” O wise and
honourable resolve——’</p>

<p>Irrepressible applause broke in upon this peroration,
and just here. The Regent was observed to be deeply
moved. He had covered his face with his hand; he could
not bear (it was thought) to hear himself so openly praised.
When silence was restored, in obedience to his lifted hand,
speaking with difficulty, he said, ‘I thank you, Mr.
Buchanan, for your honourable and earnest words; none
the less honourable in yourself in that the subject of your
praise is unworthy of them. Alas! what can a man do,
set in the midst of so many and great dangers, but keep
his eyes fixed upon the hope of his calling? He may
suffer grievous wounds in the heart and affections, grievous
bruises to the conscience, grievous languors of the will and
mind: but his hopes are fixed, his eyes are set to look
forward; he cannot altogether perish. Yourself, sir, whose
godly office it is to direct the motions of princes and
governors that way which is indeed the way, the truth,
and the life, can but add to the obligations which this
young (as new-born) nation must feel towards you, by
continuing me steadfast in those things for which you
praise me. I am touched by many compunctious thorns—I
cannot say all that I would. I have suffered long and
in private—I feel myself strangely—I am not strong
enough as yet. So do you, Mr. Buchanan, so do you to
me-ward, that I may run, sir; and that, running—please the
Lord and Father of us all—that, running, I may obtain.’</p>

<p class="tb">It was felt on all hands that more would have been a
superfluity. Mr. Buchanan was very ready to have
continued; but my Lord Regent had need of repose; and
my Lord of Morton moved the rest of their lordships that
they go to supper: which was agreed to, and so done.</p>

<p>“His style is always rich and sometimes of a texture of almost dazzling
beauty.... In the ‘New Canterbury Tales’ there are rare elements of
beauty. The stories are mediæval to the very core, and show extraordinary
power of imaginative perception of the inner life of a distant and alien
age.”—<i>The Outlook.</i></p>

<p>“Each strikes a different note, but each is faithful to the taste of his
time, which means a stout belief in the Saints, and perhaps as genuine a
fear of ‘Old Legion,’ a delight in chivalrous deeds, in mundane pomp and
might. And behind them is the author’s genius for the creation of character
and drama, so that these Old World fancies, full of the glamour of ancient
legend, in some cases all compact of a curious, mediæval quaintness, seem
somehow extraordinarily human and true.”—<i>New York Tribune.</i></p>

<p>“The hero of Mr. Hewlett’s latest novel is Richard Cœur de Lion, whose
character is peculiarly suited to the author’s style. It is on a much wider
plan than ‘The Forest Lovers,’ and while not historical in the sense of
attempting to follow events with utmost exactness, it will be found to give
an accurate portrayal of the life of the day, such as might well be expected
from the author’s previous work. There is a varied and brilliant background,
the scene shifting from France to England, and also to Palestine.
In a picturesque way, and a way that compels the sympathies of his readers,
Mr. Hewlett reads into the heart of King Richard Cœur de Lion, showing
how he was torn by two natures and how the title ‘Yea and Nay’ was
peculiarly significant of his character.”—<i>Boston Herald.</i></p>

<p>“The tale by itself is marvellously told; full of luminous poetry;
intensely human in its passion; its style, forceful and picturesque; its
background, a picture of beauty and mysterious loveliness; the whole,
radiant with the very spirit of romanticism as lofty in tone and as serious
in purpose as an epic poem. It is a book that stands head and shoulders
above the common herd of novels—the work of a master hand.”—<i>Indianapolis
News.</i></p>

<p>“Mr. Hewlett has done one of the most notable things in recent literature,
a thing to talk about with abated breath, as a bit of master-craftsmanship
touched by the splendid dignity of real creation.”—<i>The Interior.</i></p>

<p>“A series of adventures as original as they are romantic....
‘The Forest Lovers’ is a piece of ancient arras; a thing mysteriously
beautiful, a book that is real, and, at the same time, radiant with
poetry and art. ‘The Forest Lovers’ will be read with admiration,
and preserved with something more than respect.”—<i>The Tribune</i>,
New York.</p>

<p>“A story compounded of many kinds of beauty. It has, to begin
with, enchanting beauty of background; or rather, it moves through
a beautiful world, the play of whose life upon it is subtle, beguiling,
and magical.... The story has a beautiful quality both of spirit
and of form.”—<i>The Outlook.</i></p>

<p>“The book is a joy to read and to remember, a source of clean
and pure delight to the spiritual sense, a triumph of romance reduced
to the essentials, and interpreted with a mastery of expression that
is well nigh beyond praise.”—<i>The Dial.</i></p>

<p>“There is a freshness, a vivacity about the narrative itself, as well
as about the style, that carries the reader more or less breathlessly
along from one thrilling scene to another, and leaves him at the end
with little disposition to lay down the book. We sincerely commiserate
the jaded reader who cannot find amusement in ‘The Forest
Lovers.’”—<i>The Critic.</i></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">James Lane Allen</span> says:</p>

<p>“This work, for any one of several solid reasons, must be regarded
as of very unusual interest. In the matter of style alone, it is an
achievement, an extraordinary achievement ... in the matter of
interpreting nature there are passages in this book that I have never
seen surpassed in prose fiction.”</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Hamilton W. Mabie</span> says:</p>

<p>“The plot is boldly conceived and strongly sustained; the characters
are vigorously drawn and are thrown into striking contrast....
It leads the reader far from the dusty highway; it is
touched with the penetrating power of the imagination; it has
human interest and idyllic loveliness.”—<i>Book Reviews.</i></p>

<p>“Among the younger writers of fiction there are two men whose
works are of inspiration all compact. They are Rudyard Kipling
and Maurice Hewlett.... Both these writers are faithful to human
nature, which is at the bottom of all great art and literature. In
Kipling the dominant ideal seems to be that of truth, in Hewlett it
is beauty (‘truth seen from another side’).... In the writings
of the former, truth emerges in naked force; with the author of
‘Little Novels of Italy,’ it comes forth adorned with the flowers of
art and poetry, clad in the shimmering cloth of gold of the Italian
Renaissance.”—<i>The Tribune</i>, New York.</p>

<p>“There is imagination luminous with poetry and art in this singularly
romantic collection of short stories. In the matter of style
alone, Mr. Hewlett accomplishes much that is wonderful in its delicacy
and loveliness; yet he deals with intensely human passions—passions
that with a less delicate perceptive touch or sensitiveness
to the divine in human suffering would be base and sordid.”—<i>Boston
Herald.</i></p>

<p>“Mr. Hewlett is one of those rare and happy authors who can
make niches for themselves quite apart from the ordinary trend of
literature, where invidious comparisons cannot reach them. The
quaint, mediæval quality of his ‘Forest Lovers’ has cast its spell
over countless readers, even while they questioned wherein that
spell could lie; and so it is with his latest volume.”—<i>Commercial
Advertiser.</i></p>

<p>“The style is forceful and picturesque, and the stories are so true
to their locality that they read almost like translations.”—<i>New York
Times.</i></p>
